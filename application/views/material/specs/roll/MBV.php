  <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
  <p>Because this material is so durable and strong it is ideal as a block-out material for information on external signage that is no longer applicable and covering holes on reusable gun targets etc. It also has internal usage applications in distribution and fulfilment centres. Because of the nature of the face stock material it is not possible to over print using digital printers. </p>
  <h3 >Approvals</h3>
  <p> Compliance with EN71/3 covering application on toys and European Packaging Directive 94/62/EC covering restrictions on the usage of heavy metals. This label can be used safely for food packaging and can come into direct contact with both dry and fatty foodstuffs (ISEGA Research & Development Institute, Aschaffenburg). </p>
  <h3 >Shelf Life</h3>
  <p> One year under storage conditions as defined by FINAT (Federation Internationale des Fabricants et Transformateurs d’ Adhesifs et Thermocllants sur papiers et autres supports) 20° - 25° C and 40 – 50% RH.</p>
