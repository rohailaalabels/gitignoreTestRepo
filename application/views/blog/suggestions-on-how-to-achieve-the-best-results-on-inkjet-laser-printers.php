      <h2 class="headingPost">LABEL QUALITY – WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?</h2>
      <p>Poor quality blank sheet labels are the number one cause of problems when printing labels on your
        laser or inkjet printers. You may have experienced label sheets going through your printers curling,
        or in the case of Polymer labels shrinking and wrinkling because of the increasing amounts of heat
        that will be generated by your printer during extended print runs. It is always advisable to be
        aware of the recommended duty cycle for your printer, especially the number of continuous sheets
        that can be printed, before allowing the printer to rest before restarting.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, like most things in life, selecting labels on the basis of price alone can be a false
        economy, especially when using low quality label sheets, as the adhesive can often melt and labels
        come off the sheets in the printer, causing additional problems that will take time to rectify.</p>
      <p>When shopping for your labels, it is best to always consider the quality of the materials e.g. label
        face-stock, adhesive, release liner and backing, as a quality combination is most likely to result
        in problem free printing.</p>

      <p>Even with standard paper labels the direction of the grain when converted into sheets and the number
        of labels cut into the sheets are factors that can cause the label sheet to curl, making it very
        difficult to fit into a printer feed tray and avoid jams in the transport mechanism.</p>

      <p>When this happens, you will need to reverse the curl by flexing the sheets and/or leaving the sheets
        face down on a flat surface with a weight on top, causing you delays in printing.</p>
      <p>A quality label is cut and converted in ways which mitigate against the chances of this happening and
        with a weight of Kraft backing paper designed to retain the label sheets in a flat condition.</p>
      <h2 class="headingPost">WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF A EURO-DIE?</h2>
      <p>Dry-edge label sheets have a small 1mm strip of label material removed from around the edge of the
        sheet, exposing the backing paper. Creating a dry area that prevents problems associated with
        adhesive deposits on printer rollers, enabling faster, problem free printing of label sheets. <a

      <h2 class="headingPost">LABEL AGE – HOW LONG DO LABELS LAST?</h2>
      <p>All label materials have a shelf-life, which can vary to some extent dependent upon how you store
        them. The standard industry directive is 2 years from the date of manufacture under storage
        conditions as defined by FINAT (Federation Internationale des Fabricants et Transformateurs d’
        Adhesifs et Thermocllants sur papiers et autres supports) 20° – 25° C and 40 – 50% RH.</p>
      <p>Labels past this point may look in good condition but the adhesiveness properties may have changed
        and the backing material may not retain the original properties to hold the sheets flat etc. Always
        try to store label sheets laid on a flat surface, avoiding excessive heat, humidity and direct
        sunlight and as a rule-of-thumb only purchase the quantity of labels required for a couple of months
        production and then re-order.</p>

      <h2 class="headingPost">LABEL FACE-STOCK &amp; BACKING MATERIAL – HOW IS THIS IMPORTANT?</h2>
      <p>Ink and toner will behave differently dependent upon the label material, for example the ink
        absorption and toner bonding to the surface will be different for an uncoated matt-white paper in
        comparison to a coated high-gloss paper or a transparent gloss Polymer surface. This will not
        materially impact the permanency of print providing good cartridges are used, but absorption in
        particular will influence the colour and for inkjet printers the drying time.</p>
      <p>Because dye and pigment inkjet cartridges use solutions the drying time on a coated material is
        likely to be longer than is practical on a desktop printer without a dryer. This is why all gloss
        and semi-gloss materials for inkjet printers require a chemical coating that reacts with the ink to
        dry it instantly.</p>
      <p>Some finishes of themselves might prove problematic in terms of toner bonding and ink absorption and
        this can vary between printers. The thicker the overall sheet and glossier the face-stock the more
        likely it is that the transport rollers might lose traction causing a slight misalignment of the
        sheet and print registration.</p>
      <p>Dependent on the backing paper and the heat generated in the printing process some Polymer label
        sheets may curl as a consequence but should lay-flat again if turned in the opposite direction and a
        weight applied on top. This can usually be avoided by following the duty cycle for the printer and
        not exceeding the recommended number of continuous sheets, before resting the printer. For some thin
        materials like Polypropylene on a glassine backing the heat generated by the fuser rollers in a
        laser printer will be too much and the material will melt and distort. For these reasons, it is
        always recommended that you trial sample materials before purchasing.</p>
      <h2 class="headingPost">PRINTER CARTRIDGES – WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS?</h2>
      <p>The ink or toner that you use in your printer will also influence the print quality and reproducible
        colour of your labels. OEM’s select toner materials and combinations of Polypropylene fumed silica
        and various other minerals for triboelectrification (the fusing and bonding of toner particles) that
        best suit their printer range. Similarly, OEM inks will use specific mixtures of pigments (fine
        powder suspended in liquid) and dyes (Colourants dissolved in liquid). Whereas remanufactured and
        compatible ink and toner cartridges use one utilitarian combination to suit all printer brands, with
        varying degrees of quality and reliability and may not reproduce the same quality and colour of
        print output as an OEM cartridge.</p>
      <p>Typically, remanufactured/recycled and compatible cartridges are generally cheaper to purchase than
        OEM cartridges, but as with labels you often get what you pay for. We are not suggesting that these
        types of cartridges are inferior, but you may find that the drying time is longer, increasing the
        chance of your label sheets smudging as they emerge from the printer.</p>
      <p>Also, some of these toners because they are a generic compound do not always fuse correctly and bond
        with the substrate leaving the image and text on labels prone to abrasion. Therefore, if you mix the
        types of cartridges that you use in your printer you may not be able to reproduce a consistent
        output of colour and quality on your labels.</p>
      <h2 class="headingPost">PRINTER MANUALS – ALWAYS CHECK THE OPTIONS</h2>
      <p>There are so many different printer models available, with varying levels of functionality and
        options for label printing. Therefore, it is important to ensure that you refer to your printer
        manual regarding instructions on how to print labels with your specific inkjet or laser printer
        model. If the hard copy manual is not available, you can usually find the user manual available on
        OEM’s websites and<br>
        there are often also customer support forums with advice on label printing.</p>
      <h2 class="headingPost">PRINTER CLEANING – IS THIS IMPORTANT?</h2>
      <p>It is very important to keep your printer clean to ensure trouble free printing. Paper and other
        materials that are used for printing are fibrous and shed fibres within the printer, which is
        deposited on subsequent unprinted sheets will leave a speckled effect on the printed labels when
        brushed off. A small dust-blower is an easy way to solve this however if your printer requires more
        attention in order to continue to function at top capacity then there are a few simple processes
        that will assist with this task.</p>
      <div class="image_section"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1737"

      <p>The OEM may provide specific instructions for cleaning the printer and always refer to these before
        starting. No matter which printer you use ink-jet or laser, you will need to turn the printer off
        and for complete safety we recommend disconnecting from the electrical supply by unplugging.</p>
      <p><strong>Inkjet Printer: Cleaning Cartridges or Ink Nozzles</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the cleaning process on your printer, if your computer has that software option. Click on
          “Start &gt; Printers &amp; Faxes.” </li>

      <h2 class="headingPost">TEMPLATES</h2>
      <p>Alignment issues when printing can be both mechanical and software. If the registration of your print
        is progressively off centre or outside of the label edge, then the label template being used is
        set-up incorrectly and is misaligned.</p>
      <p>The most common cause of the labels not matching with the template downloaded is the printer settings
        being used, in the above example scaling would be enabled causing the increasing misalignment and
        can be simply rectified by turning the scaling off.</p>
      <p>Check to ensure that the correct template is being used and always refer to the printer manual
        regarding instructions on the setting options for printing labels. Some printers have specific
        settings that you will need to follow.</p>
      <p>Changing the printer settings for thicker label substrates e.g. Polyethylene and transparent, or high
        gloss face-stocks is usually necessary for most printers. You will need to change the printer
        properties settings for the type of label to be printed and/or the specific thickness and
        weight.</p>
      <p>The printer settings in most models can be accessed by pressing “Print” and a user interface opens,
        in which “Properties” should be an option. In which there will be a dialogue to change print quality
        and the media to be printed.</p>
      <p>It can be useful to print out a hard copy of the blank template with the cutter guides (label edge)
        showing and feed through the printer again and print out your print file to check the alignment and
        registration, before printing labels.</p>
      <h2 class="headingPost">INK SMUDGING &amp; TONER FLAKING</h2>
      <h4>INKJET PRINTER</h4>
      <p>Papers and films made for inkjet printing have a coating which absorbs ink. If your printer is set to
        the Best Print Quality or the highest DPI setting, it is possible the printer is saturating the
        surface and the amount of ink being used will not dry quickly enough to prevent smearing and
        smudging on emergence from the printer.</p>
      <p>If you are only printing one sheet at a time and can afford to wait for the ink to dry, then this
        might not be an issue, but if you are printing multiple sheets at a time, then this will be a
        problem.</p>
      <p>The solution is to only use inkjet specific gloss and transparent label materials and to experiment
        with the print quality options to reduce the ink loading.</p>
      <h4>LASER PRINTERS</h4>
      <p>The two main causes of poor toner bonding causing flaking and smudging is either old, or poor-quality
        toner and dirty rollers. Reducing the amount of toner being used by adjusting the DPI, image
        resolution or print quality can help, but cleaning the printer and changing the toner is the best
        solution.</p>
      <h2 class="headingPost">LOADING LABELS INTO THE PRINTER</h2>
      <p>As label sheet travel through the printer’s transport path, pulled by the small transport rollers
        there can be some marginal movement which if small label sizes are being printed will be noticeable
        in the form of mis-registration of print. To help prevent this always ensure that labels have been
        fanned to remove any static that might be present and sacked neatly and centrally in the feed
        tray.</p>
      <p>Try to avoid touching the label face-stock, as fingertips leave a miniscule oil residue that can
        affect the print quality.</p>
      <h4>INKJET PRINTERS</h4>
      <p>If you are looking for inkjet label materials for your printer, visit the main site navigation bar on
        the homepage Labels by Printer Compatibility&gt; Inkjet Printers Sheets or Inkjet Printers Rolls</p>
      <h4>LASER PRINTERS</h4>
      <p>If your printer has more than one feed tray and/or sheet orientation option, refer to the manual for
        the recommended feed tray and also experiment to find what works best with different materials and
        settings.</p>

      <h2 class="headingPost">PRINT BLEED</h2>
      <p>If your design uses a full background colour, then always ensure that your artwork includes a minimum
        2mm – 3mm bleed on all sides and all text and images should be at least a further 2mm – 3mm from the
        label cutter guides (red line) as shown by the dotted green line in the example below.</p>

            </p> </div>
      <p>Check the label template selected to ensure that it is suitable for printing the artwork produced
        e.g. sufficient gap between and around labels to facilitate edge bleed if required and not outside
        of the printable area on sheets (c. 3-5mm on A4).</p>
      <p>The dotted green line represents “gutter”. This is a visual reference to assist design aesthetics and
        prevent crowding the “finished edge” (the solid red line) with text and any graphics that don’t
        require bleed.<br>

      <h4>LABEL SHEET &amp; PAPER JAMS</h4>
      <p>A common problem, when label and paper sheets fed into the printer get jammed and the printer stops

        where in the transport mechanism it is, so that the correct panel can be opened.</p>

      <p>The reason for sheets not feeding correctly are various and include printing too many sheets, in
        excess of the OEM recommendations, causing the printer to overheat. Also, unclean or old printer
        rollers will cause sheets to slip through reduced traction and jam. When the rubber printer rollers
        age and lose density, they also lose the ability to grip the sheets, causing mis-feeds and jams in
        the printer. Similarly, with some of the heavier label materials always ensure that you have
        selected the correct setting for the printer to cope with a slightly thicker material.</p>
      <h4>PAPER MISFEEDS</h4>
      <p>As with jams in the printer an uncleaned or old roller and incorrect settings for the heavier/thicker
        label sheet is usually the cause of this problem from the feed tray. Check the settings are correct
        for the label material being used and that the pick-up and small transport rollers are free of dust
        and/or adhesive and are not in need of replacing. If the problem persists then it may require use of
        the manual feed option in the immediate term until the problem can be solved.</p>

      <h4>PRINTED LINES ON SHEETS</h4>
      <p>This sometimes occurs on laser printers if the cleaner bar inside the printer is not clean. New toner
        cartridges are usually supplied with a replacement cleaner bar, replace the cleaner bar and print a
        test sheet to ensure that the issue has been resolved.</p>
      <h4>SOFTWARE ISSUES</h4>
      <p>Problems caused by software can produce scrambled image and text, or none at all, just blank areas.
        This is due to file corruption and/or incompatibility, try updating the print driver, or completely
        remove the old driver an install a new one. Alternatively, the elements of the file that you are
        using may not be supported e.g. font styles, which if not installed on your PC and encrypted will
        print with bold line uprights. Similarly, the program that you are using such as Adobe Acrobat or MS
        Word may not support elements of the print file that you are using. </p>
