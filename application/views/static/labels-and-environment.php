            <p class="text-justify">
                Labels play a critical role in the communication and marketing of products, services and organisational
                values. The growing concern for the environment, combined with the visibility of labels, has led to a
                growing number of requests from customers for information and insight into the environmental impact of
                labels. Parallel to this trend, a growing number of companies in FMCG are integrating sustainability
                into their core business and packaging materials, which is helping to raise awareness. A first step in
                the process of understanding this issue is often to gain insight into the environmental performance of
                the materials used and to work with suppliers to jointly develop good environmental practices that
                reduce and ultimately remove harmful outcomes.

                        disappear completely but sometimes leave metal residue, Compostable materials create nutrients.

                            opposite to recyclable, because rather than reusing something it is letting it break down.
                            According to the Cambridge Dictionary the term compostable is defined as, “Something that is
                            compostable can be used as compost when it decays.” While in Merriam-Webster the term
                            compostable is defined as, “a decayed mixture of plants that is used to improve the soil in
                            a garden.”</p>

                            definition itself
                            is self-explanatory, compost is made almost completely of plants of some sort that can
                            ultimately be broken down into something called “Humus” which is then added and mixed within
                            earth to create nutrient rich, water retaining soil that is good for growing plants.
                            Compostable Polymers behave much like other compostable materials in the sense that it needs
                            a catalyst such as the heat generated by bacteria to break it down into compost.</p></div>

                            distinct of the three. The Cambridge Dictionary describes this as “Able to be recycled.”
                            Merriam-Webster defines recyclable as, “to make something new again” which, in its essence,
                            is accurately stated.</p>

                        <p><br>The idea of the term recyclable is to find another use for something, whether it’s the
                            same object or restoring it to its original state and reusing it. This term applies to most
                            label materials, papers and Polymers but is perhaps often used incorrectly as the
                            "catch-all" term for a sustainable product.</p>

                            However, in sustainability terms it is possibly the most important, as it contradicts the

                            is Wood-Free Paper?</h2>
                        <p class="text-justify">The term “wood-free” is often interspersed with “free-sheet” and is used
                            to describe 2 different paper types:</p>
                        <p>
                            The first is made from wood, but no longer contain wood, because the wood is chemically
                            treated to release lignin and produce a pulp that is nearly pure cellulose. Lignin is
                            essentially the glue that holds the cellulose fibres together in a tree. It is darker in
                            colour and gives paper opacity, but does not add strength and makes paper less white. By
                            contrast mechanical (or ground wood) papers are made by mechanically grinding the wood to
                            create pulp and in mechanical pulp the lignin remains and therefore the paper is not
                            wood-free.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tree-free papers are made from plants like Kenaf, which is related to cotton and can produce
                            as much fibre in one year as pine would do in twenty. Although not widespread at the moment
                            paper making from non-tree sources is growing.

                            While paper labels and water-borne acrylic adhesive are biodegradable, previously and
                            traditionally the layer of Silicone used as a release liner on the liner/backing paper to
                            prevent the label adhesive from curing and making the labels impossible to remove, has not
                            been. Which has meant that the backing sheets or rolls remaining once the labels have been
                            applied have been sent for incineration or landfill.</p>

                            the need for a Silicone release liner by polishing the surface of the backing paper/liner
                            through a process called “Calendering” or “Super Calendering” making the paper impervious to
                            the pressure sensitive adhesive on the label and keeping it in an inert condition until
                            removed and applied.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">In paper manufacturing, calendering is the process of smoothing the
                            surface of the paper by pressing it between hard pressure cylinders or rollers, “the
                            calendars” at the end of the papermaking process. Calendering is a standard part of the
                            papermaking process and occurs in-line as the paper is being manufactured. It is usually the
                            last step of the process before the paper is cut to standard sizes. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">When an additional set of offline calendars called super-calenders
                            are used after the initial papermaking process but before the paper is trimmed to size, they
                            produce an even smoother and glossier paper called super-calendered paper or SC paper. The
                            super-calender consists of several cylinders alternating between polished metal and soft
                            resilient surfaces. The super-calender runs at high speed and applies pressure, heat, and
                            friction to glaze both surfaces of the paper, making them smooth and glossy.</p>

                            comparison with the residual in empty cartridges requiring disposal. The droplets of ink
                            used to create print are extremely small (usually between 50 – 60 microns in diameter), so
                            small that they are less than the diameter of a human hair (80 microns). The amount of ink

                            inkjet ink is dependent on the ingredients used in its production. Desktop inkjet printers,
                            as used in offices or at home, tend to use aqueous inks based on a mixture of water, glycol
                            and dyes or pigments. These inks are inexpensive to manufacture, but are difficult to
                            control on the surface of media, often requiring specially coated “Inkjet” media.</p>

                            Laser printers use a combination of toner, static electricity, and heat to produce printed
                            documents and labels. Many customers ask the question; is toner biodegradable? More
                            importantly with the need for environmental sustainability gaining traction, is it
                            recyclable?

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Toner is a densely-packed chemical powder with electromagnetic properties, it is not a form
                            of ink. It is not biodegradable because of its composition of chemicals and Polymer resin.
                            Some toners contain iron oxide, styrene ad acrylate, which do not break-down and are
                            associated with environmental damage.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">In addition, black toner almost always contains carbon black, which is a
                            fine, soot-like powder, closely related to coal and pencil lead which is on the WHO (World
                            Health Organisation) watch-list
                            and classifies it as a possible Class 2B carcinogen.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">The Polymer resin also prevents toner from breaking down naturally. This
                            resin is a plastic-based molecule which helps the carbon black and other chemicals fuse to
                            the paper during printing.
