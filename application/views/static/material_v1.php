                          <p> There are four main component elements in a self adhesive label. The top layer, or face-stock is a paper, or filmic material e.g. Polypropylene, with an adhesive applied to the back and the top prepared for printing. These two elements form the label itself. </p>
                          <p> There are a variety of different types of adhesives available, but the majority are either a general purpose permanent acrylic, or rubber based pressure sensitive adhesive.</p>
                          
                          <p>The bottom layer is usually a paper or filmic backing material (release liner) for carrying the label through the print process, before the label is applied to a product, or substrate.</p>

<p>The fourth element in the labels construction is a silicone release coating is added to the backing material to facilitate the removal of the label for application.</p>

                          <li><strong>PET  </strong> Polyethylene films are characterised by being a hard, stiff and strong dimensionally stable 	material that absorbs very little water. It has good chemical resistance, except to alkalis 	(which hydrolyse the material). In very thin formats it can be highly transparent and 	colourless, but thicker 	label sections are usually opaque and off-white. This material is a 	good choice when resistance to water, oil or chemicals is important. Because of its thickness 	it is best used on flat surfaces.</li>

                            <li>Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE): has low stiffness, is tear resistant, and issued often for squeezable containers, including those with irregular shapes such as cartons. LDPE also can be made very clear, but is also manufactured to be super white, bright glossy white, transparent and metallised which gives a glossy metal look to products.</li>
                           
                            <li>High Density Polyethylene (HDPE): HDPE is much stiffer, and tends to be milky or frosted looking in appearance. It is more puncture resistant as well.</li>

                          <li><strong>PP </strong> Polypropylene film face-stocks are derived from petroleum using cost-effective high-yield 	polyolefin resins. This film’s face-stock has similar properties to Polyethylene but is stronger, 	more rigid, and offers more temperature resistance. Efficient to produce, Polypropylene, or 	PP films, require less energy and fewer raw materials than most other film substrates. 	Polypropylene films are oriented, or stretched in one direction called a mono-axial film 	(OPP), or in both directions called a biaxial-oriented film (BOPP). This orienting or stretching 	of the film produces better optical qualities, while providing stiffness and high tensile 	strength. PP film provides good durability and dimensional stability; additionally these films 	in clear formats provide high clarity and are typically selected to achieve the “no-label” look.</li>

                          <li><strong>PE </strong> Polyester is unaffected by moisture and practically impermeable to odours, and Polyester 	base materials are available in clear, white, metallised, and silver. Optically clear over-	laminates are also available. Polyester labels are well-suited for outdoor applications where 	they may be exposed to the elements. PET also comes in tamper-evident varieties, which 	show a void or other pattern when the label is removed. Films are often used in applications 	that require flexibility of the label material e.g. soft plastic containers/dispensers such as 	sauces, shampoo and shower gels.<br>

                        <p> Good adhesion is of primary importance in many label  applications, although there are applications where the requirement is for the  label to be removable, or to not adhere immediately where alignment is  critical.</p>

                        <p>The backing material seldom influences your label design, but the chosen backing with its silicone release coating is a factor that is important in the production and application phase.</p>
                        <p> <strong>Glassine  backing materials</strong><br>
                          This backing material is typically available in  transparent, white and honey for roll stock labels. The backing material is  uncoated and is available in a variety of weights.</p>
                        <p><strong>High-density  glassine</strong><br>
                          High-density glassine backings have a lower deviation  in thickness and a higher density. This means that they perform better when  die-cutting filmic face materials, compared to regular glassine or kraft  backings.</p>
                        <p><strong>Filmic backing  materials</strong><br>
                          Polyester (PET) or polypropylene (PP) backing  materials are clear and specially designed for use with transparent filmic face  materials in applications requiring excellent clarity. Film backing provide a smooth adhesive layer for  uniform contact with the face material and have good strength characteristics  for high-speed (volume) production and demanding applications.</p>
                        <p><strong>Kraft backing materials</strong><br>
                          Kraft backings are coated on one side and are more  rigid than either glassine or high-density glassine backings of the same  weight. Kraft backings are used in both sheet stock (A3/SRA3) and A4  applications because they provide a suitable backing that feeds smoothly into  copier, inkjet and laser printers. A kraft backing is also ideal when the  application requires flat sheet conversion. </p>

                          <p>This face material is designed for the manufacture of labels on rolls and sheets for use in copier, inkjet, laser and thermal transfer printers (uncoated white only). The surface structure provides excellent toner bonding and print resolution.</p>
                          <p>This product is ideal for label applications where face stock appearance is less important such as address, instruction and inventory labels and many other applications. The uncoated face-stock provides limited resistance to moisture, temperature & chemicals.</p>
                          <h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The face-stock complies with the RoHS guidelines on Electric & Electronic Equipment, the safety European directive 2009/48/CE. Contact with foodstuff (BfR XXXVI) and the Packaging & Packaging Waste Directive 94/62/CE.</p>
                          <p>The adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislation FDA 21; CFR 175, 105 and the German recommendations XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung) the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Both of which state that the adhesive can be used in direct contact with dry, moist and non-fatty foodstuffs, however according to the FDA regulations the adhesive must be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional barrier. Also EN 71-3 and EN 71-9 for Toy Safety and the Packaging & Packaging Waste Directive 94/62/CE.</p>

                         <p> This face material is designed for the manufacture of labels on rolls and sheets for use in inkjet, laser (Because of the aluminium coating on the back of the paper face-stock, some makes/models of laser printers can have difficulty printing these label sheets. Therefore it is always advisable to request a sample before ordering.) and thermal transfer printers (uncoated white only). The surface structure provides excellent ink, resin/wax and toner bonding, with good quality print resolution.</p>

<p>This product is ideal for label applications where high initial tack and strong adhesive bonding is required because of silicone protective coating, such as new rubber tyres, automotive body parts , stainless steel sink units and waxy fruits, such as Honeydew melons. Product labels that require total opacity and barrier effect.</p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p> This face material is designed for the manufacture of labels on rolls and sheets for use in copier, inkjet, laser and thermal transfer printers (uncoated white only). The surface structure provides excellent toner bonding and print resolution. </p>
                          <p> This product is ideal for label applications where face stock appearance is less important such as address, instruction and inventory labels and many other applications. The Face-Stock provides limited resistance to moisture, temperature & chemicals. </p>
                          <p> The label has been primarily designed for the purpose of labelling high value products, removable after purchase, but has numerous other applications, such as temporary delegate and guest badges, access and entry labels, charity clothing labels etc. </p>
                          <h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislation FDA 21; CFR 175, 105 and the German recommendations XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung) the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Both of which state that the adhesive can be used in direct contact with dry, moist and non-fatty foodstuffs, however according to the FDA regulations the adhesive must be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional barrier.</p>
                          <h3 >Shelf Life</h3>
                          <p> Two years under storage conditions as defined by FINAT (Federation Internationale des Fabricants et Transformateurs d’ Adhesifs et Thermocllants sur papiers et autres supports) 20° - 25° C and 40 – 50% RH.</p>

<h3>Additional Information</h3>
                          <p>The  test of resistance to immersion in water/ice is carried out by sticking a blank  (unprinted) label on a standard glass bottle. Five days later the bottle with  label applied is submerged in an ice bucket containing ice and water for a  minimum period of 4 hours and the labels resistance to immersion is checked.</p>

                          <p>Available with a general purpose permanent acrylic based, pressure sensitive adhesive. The adhesive is characterised by a high initial tack, excellent adhesion and good low temperature performance on a wide variety of substrates. This adhesive should not be exposed to direct sunlight and/or high temperatures for long periods of time.</p>
<h3>Additional Information</h3>
                          <p>The  test of resistance to immersion in water/ice is carried out by sticking a blank  (unprinted) label on a standard glass bottle. Five days later the bottle with  label applied is submerged in an ice bucket containing ice and water for a  minimum period of 4 hours and the labels resistance to immersion is checked.</p>

                          <h3 >Adhesive</h3>
                          <p>The adhesive has a very high tack even on cold surfaces, down to -10° C. Due to the high initial tack, even on moist surfaces, the adhesive is particularly suited for labelling both polar and non-polar surfaces, such as plastic containers, film wrappings and other packaging materials. This adhesive is also very suitable for fast running dispensers, on which the initial tack strength has to be built-up extremely quickly, when the labels are blown on to the substrate. Once labelled this adhesive is highly waterproof.</p>

                           <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>This face material is designed for the over labelling of errors, or informational changes on existing printed materials and/or signage. Also for bar-coding on asset labels where the underlying substrate might interfere with the labels scan-ability. </p>
  <p>The semi-gloss face-stock provides excellent print quality by digital laser printing and thermal transfer. Due to its opacity the label material obscures surface completely.</p>
<h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislation FDA 21; CFR 175, 105 and the German recommendations XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung) the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Both of which state that the adhesive can be used in direct contact with dry, moist and non-fatty foodstuffs, however according to the FDA regulations the adhesive must be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional barrier.</p>
<h3 >STORAGE CONDITIONS & SHELF LIFE</h3>
                          <p>Storing at a temperature of 20 ± 5° C and a relative humidity (RH) range of 45 ± 50% the reasonable shelf life expectancy is 2 years from the date of material production. Moisture, heat and direct sunlight, should be avoided during storage and dark storage is recommended to keep labels and material in optimum condition.</p>

                          <p>Very popular  for information labelling where label durability is important and over-printing  is required by laser or thermal transfer, such as &ldquo;hazchem&rdquo; labels where the  pictograms to be used within the printed red borders are interchangeable  dependent upon the container contents. Recommended for drum and logistics  industry labelling.</p>
                          <p>Ideal for A4 and cut-size applications, with good  removability, UV stability (non-yellowing) and water resistance once labelled.  Limited adhesion on very rough surfaces and not recommended for labelling PVC  substrates. </p>
                          <h3>Conversion &amp; Printing</h3>
                          <p>Due to the pre-treatment, the film is printable by common label printing methods like letterpress, flexography, screen and offset as well as copier and laser toner printers, but in all cases inks designed for non-absorbent materials should be used.</p>
                          
                          
                          
<h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The research  centre ISEGA (EN ISO 17025 accreditation for analytics and EN 45011 for  certification) has given the adhesive and approval according to the European  requirements for direct contact with dry and moist, non-fatty foodstuffs and  according to FDA regulations adhesive may come into direct contact with dry  foodstuffs, or it must be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional  barrier. Furthermore the adhesive may come into contact with poultry, dry  foodstuffs as well as fruit and vegetables.</p>
                          <p>The adhesive  is also in compliance with the demands of the Code of Federal Regulations, Food  &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) 21 CFR Ch. 01 (01.04.2012) 175.105 &amp;  175.125</p>
                          
                          <p>This  product complies with the materials section of BS5609 Part 2 (Marine  Immersion), which is a recognised standard for self-adhesive labels for marine  use. It contains provisions to ensure that dangerous goods transported by sea  should be durably labelled and identified. This includes surviving immersion at  sea.</p>
                          <p>Section  2 details the requirements for pressure-sensitive adhesive laminates and rates  their performance in terms of dimensional stability, adhesion, artificial  weathering, temperature cycling and colour fastness, together with exposure to  marine conditions for three months. </p>
                          <p>Customers  converting labels themselves should independently determine the compliance of  the ink and print process involved in the production of labels to the British  Standard. </p>
<h3 >Shelf Life</h3>
                          <p>From the  date of manufacture 2 years at 20° C and RH50%. Prolonged storage at higher  temperatures and/or humidity levels will shorten the shelf in optimum condition  terms.</p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>A specially designed laser printable material which  is very popular for product, logistics and industrial applications, including  variable information, where label durability and removability is required, typically in retail for books,  greeting cards, electrical and IT items, also secondary promotional labels, but  equally useful for temporary guest and delegate badges. It can also be  used in address labelling or informational labels in difficult environmental  conditions and in SOHO (small office, home office) end uses  for removable applications.</p>
                          <p>Ideal for A4 and cut-size applications, with good  removability, UV stability (non-yellowing) and water resistance once labelled.  Limited adhesion on very rough surfaces and not recommended for labelling PVC  substrates.</p>
<h3>Conversion &amp; Printing</h3>
                          <p>Due to the  pre-treatment, the film is printable by common label printing methods like  letterpress, flexography, screen and offset as well as copier and laser toner  printers, but in all cases inks designed for non-absorbent materials should be  used.</p>
<h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The research  centre ISEGA (EN ISO 17025 accreditation for analytics and EN 45011 for  certification) has given the adhesive and approval according to the European  requirements for direct contact with dry and moist, non-fatty foodstuffs and  according to FDA regulations adhesive may come into direct contact with dry  foodstuffs, or it must be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional  barrier. Furthermore the adhesive may come into contact with poultry, dry  foodstuffs as well as fruit and vegetables. </p><p>
                          The adhesive  is also in compliance with the demands of the Code of Federal Regulations, Food  &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) 21 CFR Ch. 01 (01.04.2012) 175.105 &amp;  175.125</p>
<h3 >Shelf Life</h3>
                          <p>From the  date of manufacture 2 years at 20° C and RH50%. Prolonged storage at higher  temperatures and/or humidity levels will shorten the shelf in optimum condition  terms.</p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>This  label material performs excellently on very difficult surfaces e.g. HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) drums. The product also offers  good medium-life durability and is therefore ideal for tracking/warehouse  applications and also product/component identification in industrial  applications.</p>
<h3>Conversion &amp; Printing</h3>
                          <p>The  label has been specifically designed for sheet-fed and continuous laser  printing through high speed industrial laser printers. The product displays  optimal flatness during conversion, storage and the industrial laser printer  processing. Some curl may be seen on exiting the printer but this will flatten  quickly. The backing paper is specially suited to the more critical  re-fan-folding demands of high-speed computer printers, providing optimum  lay-flatness and excellent inter-folding characteristics.</p>
                          <p>The  product is also suitable for overprinting with other print technologies i.e.  dot matrix, thermal transfer (in combination with the correct ribbon grade and  machine adjustment), ink jet (up to 720 dpi). The face-stock can also be  pre-printed by conventional printing processes, such as flexographic and offset  lithographic. For flexographic good results can be achieved with water or  solvent-based printing inks. Consult your printing ink supplier about suitable  printing inks for your application.</p>
                          <p>In  view of the enormous variety of printers on the market we recommend carrying  out process trials beforehand.</p>
<h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The  adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislation FDA 21; CFR  175, 105 and the German recommendations XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung) the German Federal  Institute for Risk Assessment. Both of which state that the adhesive can be  used in direct contact with dry, moist and non-fatty foodstuffs, however  according to the FDA regulations the adhesive must be separated from the  foodstuffs by a functional barrier.</p>
<h3 >Shelf Life</h3>
                          <p>Two years under storage conditions as defined by FINAT (Federation Internationale des Fabricants et Transformateurs  d&rsquo; Adhesifs et Thermocllants sur papiers et autres supports) 20° - 25° C and 40 – 50% RH. </p>

                          <p>Very popular  for information labelling where label durability is important and over-printing  is required by laser or thermal transfer, such as &ldquo;hazchem&rdquo; labels where the  pictograms to be used within the printed red borders are interchangeable  dependent upon the container contents. Recommended for drum and logistics  industry labelling.</p>
                          <p>Ideal for A4 and cut-size applications, with good  removability, UV stability (non-yellowing) and water resistance once labelled.  Limited adhesion on very rough surfaces and not recommended for labelling PVC  substrates.</p>
                          <h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The research  centre ISEGA (EN ISO 17025 accreditation for analytics and EN 45011 for  certification) has given the adhesive and approval according to the European  requirements for direct contact with dry and moist, non-fatty foodstuffs and  according to FDA regulations adhesive may come into direct contact with dry  foodstuffs, or it must be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional  barrier. Furthermore the adhesive may come into contact with poultry, dry  foodstuffs as well as fruit and vegetables.
                          </p>
                          <p>This  product complies with the materials section of BS5609 Part 2 (Marine  Immersion), which is a recognised standard for self-adhesive labels for marine  use. It contains provisions to ensure that dangerous goods transported by sea  should be durably labelled and identified. This includes surviving immersion at  sea.</p>
                          <p>Section  2 details the requirements for pressure-sensitive adhesive laminates and rates  their performance in terms of dimensional stability, adhesion, artificial  weathering, temperature cycling and colour fastness, together with exposure to  marine conditions for three months. </p>
                          <p>Customers  converting labels themselves should independently determine the compliance of  the ink and print process involved in the production of labels to the British  Standard. </p>
<h3 >Shelf Life</h3>
                          <p>From the  date of manufacture 2 years at 20° C and RH50%. Prolonged storage at higher  temperatures and/or humidity levels will shorten the shelf in optimum condition  terms.</p>

                          <h3>Limitations</h3>
                          <p>Limited adhesion at low temperatures and the highest end-use temperature must be separately checked together with the face material.</p>
                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>Applications  are predominately in market segments where rigid containers are used (e.g.  glass, polyester/PET). Due to the fairly rigid nature of the film, care should  be taken with application and use on non-uniform surfaces and/or where a very  high level of flexibility or squeezability is required (e.g. soap and shower  gel containers). A particularly good choice for primary brand and product  labels on rigid containers where it is important for the content to be visible  and not partially obscured by a label. Also secondary promotional labels,  informational labels, external labels/signage and safety labels/signage etc.</p>
<h3>Conversion &amp; printing</h3>
                          <p>Due to  the pre-treatment, the film is printable by common label printing methods like  letterpress, flexography, screen, offset lithography and digital printers  (copiers and laser). Special inks designed for non-absorbent materials should  be used.</p>
<h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The research centre ISEGA has given an approval  according to the European requirements for direct contact with dry and moist  and fatty foodstuffs, which have a reduction factor of at least 4 according to  the regulation EU No. 10/2011. (ISEGA has an EN ISO 17025 accreditation for analytics and EN 45011 for  certification)</p>
<h3 >Shelf Life</h3>
                          <p>One year under  storage conditions as defined by FINAT (Federation  Internationale des Fabricants et Transformateurs d&rsquo; Adhesifs et Thermocllants  sur papiers et autres supports) 20° - 25° C and 40 – 50% RH. In original packaging  and protected from light. </p>

<h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>A  specially designed laser printable material which is very popular for product,  logistics and industrial applications, including variable information, where  label durability and removability is required, typically in retail for books,  greeting cards, electrical and IT items, also secondary promotional labels, but  equally useful for temporary guest and delegate badges. It can also be used in  address labelling or informational labels in difficult environmental conditions  and in SOHO (small office, home office) end uses for  removable applications.</p>
                          <p>Ideal  for A4 and cut-size applications, with good removability, UV stability  (non-yellowing) and water resistance once labelled. Limited adhesion on very  rough surfaces and not recommended for labelling PVC substrates.</p>
<h3>Conversion &amp; printing</h3>
                          <p>Due to  the pre-treatment, the film is printable by common label printing methods like  letterpress, flexography, screen, offset lithography and digital printers  (copiers and laser). Special inks designed for non-absorbent materials should  be used.</p>
<h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The research centre ISEGA has given an approval  according to the European requirements for direct contact with dry and moist  and fatty foodstuffs, which have a reduction factor of at least 4 according to  the regulation EU No. 10/2011. (ISEGA has an EN ISO 17025 accreditation for analytics and EN 45011 for  certification)</p>
<h3 >Shelf Life</h3>

<h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>Applications are predominately in market segments where rigid containers are used (e.g. glass, polyester/PET). Due to the fairly rigid nature of the film, care should be taken with application and use on non-uniform surfaces and/or where a very high level of flexibility or squeezability is required (e.g. soap and shower gel containers). A particularly good choice for primary brand and product labels on rigid containers where it is important for the content to be visible and not partially obscured by a label. Also secondary promotional labels, informational labels, external labels/signage and safety labels/signage etc.</p>
                          <p>With the British standard (BS) compliance for the marine performance test this material is widely used for haz-chem labels on drums and containers.</p>
                         
<h3>Conversion &amp; printing</h3>
                          <p>This product is specifically designed for hot fuse sheet-fed and continuous (colour) laser printing. Providing optimal flatness during conversion, storage and laser printing processing. Some slight curl may be seen on exiting the printer but this will flatten quickly.</p>
<h3>Approvals</h3>
     <p>The face-stock complies with EN 71-3 for Toy Safety, Electric & Electronic Equipment RoHS and the Packaging & Packaging Waste Directive 94/62/CE.
The adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislations, FDA 175.105 and the German recommendations XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Riskobewertung) the German Federal Institute for risk assessment. The adhesive can be used in direct contact with dry and moist, non-fatty foodstuffs ISEGA - Adhesives.
</p>
<p>This product complies with the materials section of BS5609 Part 2 (Marine Performance Test). Customers should independently determine the compliance or otherwise of the ink and print process involved in the production of labels to the British standard.</p>
<p>While the release liner complies with the German regulation on Contact with foodstuff BfR XXXVI for Face-stock & Liners (Paper), the Packaging & Packaging Waste Directive 94/62/CE, EN 71-3 for Toy Safety and Electric & Electronic Equipment RoHS.</p>

<h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>This material is perfect for applications that  require a degree of flexibility from the label (e.g. soap and shower gel  containers). A particularly good choice for primary brand and product labels on  flexible and rigid containers where it is important for the content to be  visible and not partially obscured by a label. Also secondary promotional  labels, informational labels, external labels/signage and safety labels/signage  etc.</p>
                          <h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The adhesive complies with the European food  directives and legislation FDA 21; CFR 175, 105 and the German recommendations  XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung)  the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Both of which state that the  adhesive can be used in direct contact with dry, moist and non-fatty  foodstuffs, however according to the FDA regulations the adhesive must be  separated from the foodstuffs by a functional barrier.</p>
<h3 >Shelf Life</h3>
                          <p>Two years under storage conditions as  defined by Premier Coating &amp; Converters Ltd 20° - 28° C and 40 – 60% RH.</p>

                          <p>Because this material is so durable and strong it is  ideal as a block-out material for information on external signage that is no  longer applicable and covering holes on reusable gun targets etc. It also has  internal usage applications in distribution and fulfilment centres. Because of  the nature of the face stock material it is not possible to over print using  digital printers.</p>
<h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>Compliance with EN71/3 covering application on toys  and European Packaging Directive 94/62/EC covering restrictions on the usage of  heavy metals. This label can be used safely for food packaging and  can come into direct contact with both dry and fatty foodstuffs (ISEGA Research &amp;  Development Institute, Aschaffenburg). </p>

                          <h3 >ADHESIVE</h3>
                        <p>This adhesive offers good tack combined with excellent removability from most surfaces, even after long-term labelling. Thanks to its well-balanced adhesive characteristics this removable adhesive is perfectly suited for a wide variety of applications. However the lower adhesion properties are likely to be insufficient for applications on curved surfaces. The adhesive is resistant to light, heat and ageing. </p>

                          <p>This product is designed for use in retail item level applications, such as weight label material on food packaging and provides excellent grades with EAN and other barcodes. Other typical end user applications include front of store labelling, process tracking, POS and item variable information labelling. </p>
                          <p>As economy thermal papers are not equipped with a protective surface coat, the labels should not be exposed to water or greasy substances. Also the image may fade over a period of time if applied to surfaces containing plasticisers e.g. Flexible Polyvinyl Chloride.</p>
                          <h3 >Conversion & Printing</h3>
                          <p> The face-stock offers a good quality of imprint provided that solvent-free inks and varnishes are applied. Inks should be suitable for printing thermal papers and consultation with the ink supplier is advised. Suitability tests should be performed under customer-specific conditions, as unpredictable interactions with the ink may occur, due to the lack of a protective coating. Web temperature during curing should not exceed 50° C in order to prevent premature imaging, or discolouration. </p>
                          <p>Printing speeds of up to 250mm/s are possible in direct thermal printing.</p>
                          <h3 >Approvals – Regulations concerning contact with food.</h3>
                          <p>The thermal paper grade face-stock, is physiologically and toxicologically safe and may therefore be used in printers and scales for the marking of goods. However they can only be applied in direct contact with those groups of foodstuffs, which are washed and/or peeled, before consumption. ISEGA (Research & Development Institute, Aschaffenburg).</p>
                          <p>The adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislation FDA 21; CFR 175, 105 and the German recommendations XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung) the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. All of which state that the adhesive can be used in direct contact with dry, moist and non-fatty foodstuffs, however according to the FDA regulations the adhesive must be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional barrier.</p>
                          <p>The release liner complies with recommendation BfR XXXVI</p>

                          <h3 >ADHESIVE</h3>
                       <p>This adhesive offers good tack combined with excellent removability from most surfaces, even after long-term labelling. Thanks to its well-balanced adhesive characteristics this removable adhesive is perfectly suited for a wide variety of applications. However the lower adhesion properties are likely to be insufficient for applications on curved surfaces. The adhesive is resistant to light, heat and ageing.</p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                         <p>This product is designed for use in retail item level applications, such as “eye catching” promotional labelling, along with many other commercial and industrial applications requiring the printing of variable data and/or information. It also provides excellent grades with EAN and other barcodes. Other typical end user applications include front of store labelling, process tracking, POS and item labelling. </p>
                         <p>As economy thermal papers are not equipped with a protective surface coat, the labels should not be exposed to water or greasy substances. Also the image may fade over a period of time if applied to surfaces containing plasticisers e.g. Flexible Polyvinyl Chloride.</p>
                          
                         
                         <h3 >Conversion & Printing</h3>
                          <p>The face-stock offers a good quality of imprint provided that solvent-free inks and varnishes are applied. Inks should be suitable for printing thermal papers and consultation with the ink supplier is advised. Suitability tests should be performed under customer-specific conditions, as unpredictable interactions with the ink may occur, due to the lack of a protective coating. Web temperature during curing should not exceed 50° C in order to prevent premature imaging, or discolouration.</p>  
                          <p>Printing speeds of up to 250mm/s are possible in direct thermal printing.</p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                        <p>This product is designed for use in retail item level applications, such as “eye catching” promotional labelling, along with many other commercial and industrial applications requiring the printing of variable data and/or information. It also provides excellent grades with EAN and other barcodes. Other typical end user applications include front of store labelling, process tracking, POS and item labelling. </p>   
                        <p>As economy thermal papers are not equipped with a protective surface coat, the labels should not be exposed to water or greasy substances. Also the image may fade over a period of time if applied to surfaces containing plasticisers e.g. Flexible Polyvinyl Chloride.</p> 
                       
                         
                         <h3 >CONVERSION & PRINTING</h3>
                         <p>The face-stock offers a good quality of imprint provided that solvent-free inks and varnishes are applied. Inks should be suitable for printing thermal papers and consultation with the ink supplier is advised. Suitability tests should be performed under customer-specific conditions, as unpredictable interactions with the ink may occur, due to the lack of a protective coating. Web temperature during curing should not exceed 50° C in order to prevent premature imaging, or discolouration.</p> 
                         <p>Printing speeds of up to 250mm/s are possible in direct thermal printing.</p>

                       <h3 >ADHESIVE</h3>
                     <p>This adhesive offers good tack combined with excellent removability from most surfaces, even after long-term labelling. Thanks to its well-balanced adhesive characteristics this removable adhesive is perfectly suited for a wide variety of applications. However the lower adhesion properties are likely to be insufficient for applications on curved surfaces. The adhesive is resistant to light, heat and ageing. </p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                        <p>This product is designed for use in retail item level applications, such as “eye catching” promotional labelling, along with many other commercial and industrial applications requiring the printing of variable data and/or information. It also provides excellent grades with EAN and other barcodes. Other typical end user applications include front of store labelling, process tracking, POS and item labelling. </p>
                        
                        <p>As economy thermal papers are not equipped with a protective surface coat, the labels should not be exposed to water or greasy substances. Also the image may fade over a period of time if applied to surfaces containing plasticisers e.g. Flexible Polyvinyl Chloride.</p>
                        
                         
                         <h3 >CONVERSION & PRINTING</h3>
                       <p>The face-stock offers a good quality of imprint provided that solvent-free inks and varnishes are applied. Inks should be suitable for printing thermal papers and consultation with the ink supplier is advised. Suitability tests should be performed under customer-specific conditions, as unpredictable interactions with the ink may occur, due to the lack of a protective coating. Web temperature during curing should not exceed 50° C in order to prevent premature imaging, or discolouration.</p>
                       
                       <p>Printing speeds of up to 250mm/s are possible in direct thermal printing.</p>

                       <h3 >ADHESIVE</h3>
                     <p>This adhesive offers good tack combined with excellent removability from most surfaces, even after long-term labelling. Thanks to its well-balanced adhesive characteristics this removable adhesive is perfectly suited for a wide variety of applications. However the lower adhesion properties are likely to be insufficient for applications on curved surfaces. The adhesive is resistant to light, heat and ageing. </p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                        <p>This product is designed for use in retail item level applications, such as “eye catching” promotional labelling, along with many other commercial and industrial applications requiring the printing of variable data and/or information. It also provides excellent grades with EAN and other barcodes. Other typical end user applications include front of store labelling, process tracking, POS and item labelling. </p>
                        
                        <p>As economy thermal papers are not equipped with a protective surface coat, the labels should not be exposed to water or greasy substances. Also the image may fade over a period of time if applied to surfaces containing plasticisers e.g. Flexible Polyvinyl Chloride.</p>
                        
                         
                         <h3 >CONVERSION & PRINTING</h3>
                       <p>The face-stock offers a good quality of imprint provided that solvent-free inks and varnishes are applied. Inks should be suitable for printing thermal papers and consultation with the ink supplier is advised. Suitability tests should be performed under customer-specific conditions, as unpredictable interactions with the ink may occur, due to the lack of a protective coating. Web temperature during curing should not exceed 50° C in order to prevent premature imaging, or discolouration.</p>
                       
                       <p>Printing speeds of up to 250mm/s are possible in direct thermal printing.</p>

                        <p>The thermal paper grade face-stock, is physiologically and toxicologically safe and may therefore be used in printers and scales for the marking of goods. However they can only be applied in direct contact with those groups of foodstuffs, which are washed and/or peeled, before consumption.

                        <p>The adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislation FDA 21; CFR 175, 105 and the German recommendations XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung) the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. All of which state that the adhesive can be used in direct contact with dry, moist and non-fatty foodstuffs, however according to the FDA regulations the adhesive must be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional barrier.</p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>This face material is designed for the manufacture of labels on rolls and sheets for use in inkjet, laser (Because of the aluminium coating on the back of the paper face-stock, some makes/models of laser printers can have difficulty printing these label sheets. Therefore it is always advisable to request a sample before ordering.) and thermal transfer printers (uncoated white only). The surface structure provides excellent ink, resin/wax and toner bonding, with good quality print resolution.</p>
                        
                      <p>This product is ideal for label applications where high initial tack and strong adhesive bonding is required because of silicone protective coating, such as new rubber tyres, automotive body parts , stainless steel sink units and waxy fruits, such as Honeydew melons. Product labels that require total opacity and barrier effect.</p>

                          <p>An aqueous compounded acrylic emulsion (PSA),  pressure sensitive, permanent adhesive. This adhesive has been formulated for  label, paper and filmic applications where a permanent bond is required and is  generally suitable for application to a number of surfaces, including recycled  carton-board and can also be used in chill cabinet applications.</p>
                          <p>A block-out version designed to obscure text on the  substrate to which the label is applied is also available with a vellum  face-stock if required and minimum quantities and prices are available on  application.</p>
<h3 >Release Liner</h3>
                          <p>A one side coated solvent-less siliconised glassine  with release levels designed for high-speed rotary label conversion. The paper  has excellent punchability and is therefore suitable for sprocket fed  fan-folded products, as well as labels on rolls for automatic applications.</p>

                          <h3 >Adhesive</h3>
                          <p>The adhesive has a very high tack even on cold surfaces, down to -10° C. Due to the high initial tack, even on moist surfaces, the adhesive is particularly suited for labelling both polar and non-polar surfaces, such as plastic containers, film wrappings and other packaging materials. This adhesive is also very suitable for fast running dispensers, on which the initial tack strength has to be built-up extremely quickly, when the labels are blown on to the substrate. Once labelled this adhesive is highly waterproof.</p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                      	 <p>Applications are predominately in market segments where rigid containers are used (e.g. glass, polyester/PET). Due to the fairly rigid nature of the film, care should be taken with application and use on non-uniform surfaces and/or where a very high level of flexibility or squeezability is required (e.g. soap and shower gel containers). A good choice for primary brand and product labels on rigid containers, secondary promotional labels, asset labels, informational labels, external labels/signage and safety labels/signage etc.</p>
                        <p>Also used in label applications where a good durability and resistance against water is important.</p>
                        <h3>Conversion and printing</h3>
                          <p>The corona treated face material assists ink adhesion and can be printed by conventional printing techniques and is also suitable for Thermal Transfer printing with specific ribbons (exact inks, foils and ribbons should be specified by your ink/foil/ribbon supplier). The material has excellent register properties.</p>
                          <h3 >Approvals</h3>
                         <p>The adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislation FDA 21; CFR 175, 105 and the German recommendations XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung) the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Both of which state that the adhesive can be used in direct contact with dry, moist and non-fatty foodstuffs, however according to the FDA regulations the adhesive must be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional barrier.</p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>This face  material is a designed for a durable synthetic tag material with enhanced tear  resistance and high sensitivity for use in a wide range of applications,  including commercial tagging, wristbands, sport/game licensing, amusement pass  adn ski-lift tickets where short life, or low contamination is common.</p>
                          <p>There are  many other commercial, component, equipment and industrial applications for  short-life, durable informational labels.</p>
<h3>Conversion and printing</h3>
                          <p>This thermo-sensitive product is designed for use  in thermal printing systems at printing speeds up to 200mm/sec. The product can  also be converted by all conventional roll conversion technologies including  flexographic and UV letter-press. However due to the thermographic properties  exposure over 50°C may cause premature imaging or discolouration. Also inks  containing alcohol or volatile organic solvents may cause discolouration of the  thermo-sensitive coating. It is always advisable to test inks and varnishes  before conversion.</p>
<h3 >Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The  adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislation FDA 21; CFR  175, 105 and the German recommendations XXI as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung) the German Federal Institute for  Risk Assessment. Both of which state that the adhesive can be used in direct  contact with dry, moist and non-fatty foodstuffs with a reduction factor 2.  However according to the FDA regulations the adhesive must be separated from  the foodstuffs by a functional barrier.</p>
<h3 >Shelf Life</h3>
                          <p>One  year under storage conditions as defined by Premier Coating &amp; Converters  Ltd 20° - 25° C and  40 – 50% RH. </p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                         
                         <p>This product combines the characteristics of thermal papers with the durability of Polypropylene films and printing speeds of up to 200mm per second are possible in direct thermal printing.</p>
                         <p>The adhesive has a very high tack even on cold surfaces down to -10° C. Due to the high initial tack even on moist surfaces this label is particularly suited to labelling polar and non-polar surfaces, such as plastic containers, film wrappings and other packaging materials. The adhesive works well for fast running labels dispensers, in which the initial tack has to be built up extremely quickly, once the labels are blown onto the substrate.</p>
                         <p>Once labelled the adhesive is also highly waterproof.</p>
                         <p>The Polypropylene face-stock features a high resistance to water and oil. It does not contain BPA adn is suitable for applications in market segments where labels may require protection via the top-coat from grease and oils, such as fresh food “Delicatessen” counters, as food and meat labels. Also where abrasion may occur in commercial and industrial applications and durability is required e.g. logistics labels, luggage and packaging labels.</p>
                         
                         
                         <h3>Conversion and printing</h3>
                         <p>Although a direct thermal heat sensitive film, printing with traditional printing methods such as UV Flexo, or UV Offset Litho. However the inks should be suitable for printing thermal films and consulting the ink supplier is recommended. A corona treatment prior to printing may have a positive effect in ink trapping and adhesion. The web temperature during curing should not exceed 50° C in order to prevent an early reaction of the thermo reactive ink. </p>
                        
                         <h3>Approvals</h3>
                         <p>The thermal film according to the sample material is physiologically and toxicologically safe when used as intended and may therefore be used in printers and scales for labelling food and goods. However it may only stand in direct contact with such kind of foodstuffs which are peeled, shelled or washed before consumption according to experience.

                         <p>This product combines the characteristics of thermal papers with the durability of Polypropylene films and printing speeds of up to 200mm per second are possible in direct thermal printing.</p>
                         <p>The adhesive features good tack and adhesion in combination with superior and clean removability from most substrates. Good UV resistance and long-term removability. The adhesive allows label application at a wide temperature range and it retains its removable properties even at very low temperatures.</p>
                         <p>A durable synthetic material with enhanced tear resistance and high sensitivity for use in a wide range of applications, including commercial tagging, wristbands, sport/game licensing, amusement pass, and ski lift tickets where short life or low contamination is common. The adhesive (R5000N) removes clean from many substrates from polymeric (e.g. PET, PP, ABS), card and fibre board, aluminium, stainless steel or glass (not suitable for window labelling). The use of R5000N adhesive on certain types of cardboards, or recycled fibres can be critical and it is strongly recommended to proceed to application testing before use.</p>
                         
                         
                          <h3>Conversion and printing</h3>
                         <p>This thermo-sensitive product is designed for use in thermal printing systems at printing speeds up to 200 mm/sec. The product can be converted by all conventional roll conversion technologies including flexographic and UV letter press. However, due to the thermo-graphic properties exposure above 50°C may cause premature imaging or discolouration. Inks containing alcohol or volatile organic solvents may cause discolouration of the thermo-sensitive coating. It is advisable to test inks and varnishes before conversion. </p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>Applications are predominately in market segments where rigid containers are used (e.g. glass, polyester/PET). Due to the fairly rigid nature of the film, care should be taken with application and use on non-uniform surfaces and/or where a very high level of flexibility or squeezability is required (e.g. soap and shower gel containers). A good choice for primary brand and product labels on rigid containers, secondary promotional labels, asset labels, informational labels, external labels/signage and safety labels/signage etc. </p>
                          <p> This adhesive is suitable for use across a broad range of “wet wipe” applications and is also suitable for  many dry pack re-closure applications and can be used for promotional labels and clothing “stickers” combining excellent UV and weather resistance with good removability from most substrates e.g. glass, PET and PP. </p>
                          <p> On a few substrates (e.g. PVC, Polystyrene, PC and ABS) the adhesion tends to become stronger over the course of time and this may affect functional removability, therefore preliminary testing on such substrates is recommended. </p>
                          <h3>Conversion and printing</h3>
                          <p>The modified acrylic based top-coating can be printed by most conventional printing techniques, including flexo; screen; offset-litho; letterpress, silkscreen; gravure and hot or cold foiling processes. UV, water-based and solvent-based inks can be used. The topcoat is designed for optimum ink adhesion. On-press corona treatment is not advised. The face material is suitable for Thermal Transfer printing with specific ribbons (exact inks, foils and ribbons should be specified by your ink/foil/ribbon supplier). The material has excellent register properties, especially when a high number of colour are used.</p>
                          <h3 >Approvals</h3>
                          <p> The adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislation FDA 21; CFR 175, 105 and the German recommendations XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung) the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Both of which state that the adhesive can be used in direct contact with dry, moist and non-fatty foodstuffs, however according to the FDA regulations the adhesive must be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional barrier. </p>

                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>This  face material is designed for the manufacture of labels on rolls and sheets  specifically for use with direct thermal printers. The surface structure  incorporates a thermo-sensitive coating that produces black imaging. </p>
                          <p>This  product is ideal for label applications where a clear face stock enhances the  image and appeal of products requiring variable information labelling such as  fresh produce. Larger white direct thermal labels containing more written  content, can almost entirely obscure a packages content, whereas a clear label  can contain all of the same information, but still allow inspection of the  packages contents.</p>
                          <p>Clear  direct thermal labels also have applications beyond packaging in retail and  healthcare as they can facilitate more effective organising and labelling of  files, envelopes, shelves, racking, cups, garments, tickets and anything else  where transparency and medium shelf-life are required.</p>
<h3>Conversion & Printing</h3>
                          <p>This thermo-sensitive product is designed for use  in thermal printing systems at printing speeds up to 200mm/sec. The product can  also be converted to UV letter-press. However due to the thermographic  properties exposure over 50°C may cause premature imaging or discolouration.  Also inks containing alcohol or volatile organic solvents may cause  discolouration of the thermo-sensitive coating. It is always advisable to test  inks and varnishes before conversion.</p>
<h3 >Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The  adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislation FDA 21; CFR  175, 105 and the German recommendations XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung) the German Federal  Institute for Risk Assessment. Both of which state that the adhesive can be  used in direct contact with dry, moist and non-fatty foodstuffs with a  reduction factor 2. However according to the FDA regulations the adhesive must  be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional barrier.</p>
<h3 >Shelf Life</h3>
                          <p>Two years under storage conditions as defined by Premier Coating &amp;  Converters Ltd 20° - 25° C and 40 – 50% RH.<strong> </strong></p>
