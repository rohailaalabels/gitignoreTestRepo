  <p>Beer is said to be the third most popular beverage in the world, and it’s been with us for a very long
    time. Dating all the way back to 9000 BC in Ancient Egypt, beer remains a firm favourite, and there’s
    nothing quite like a cold beer on a hot day!</p>
  <p>The good news if you’re a fan of beer is that we’re currently going through somewhat of a renaissance at
    the moment. More and more people these days are looking to buy craft beers, as they are generally
    regarded as offering greater flavour variations than your bog standard mass-produced lager.</p>

      <p>But as we become gradually more environmentally aware, there is a big challenge facing any
        beverage or food product aside from packaging alone, and that is transportation (often referred
        to as ‘food miles’). Regardless of whether beer is made from organic materials and bottled in
        recycled glass or aluminium, it still has to be transported form producer to supplier. This
        contributes to greenhouse emissions as well as all the associated oil consumption that goes in
        to production, which seems like a lot of waste to ship what is essentially just water.</p>

      <p>Aside from the environmental argument, people are getting into crafting their own beer at home
        for fun, and even for profit. You can buy a home brewing kit for as little as £70, which
        contains everything you need to get started, and there are countless guides online that offer
        step-by-step instructions. Just don’t get carried away with reading absolutely everything you
        can find about beer making on the Internet. You may get overwhelmed and talk yourself out of the
        hobby!</p>
      <p>If you really want to get into home brewing, you don’t need to stop at beer either – you can also
        try your hand at making wine, port, cider, spirits, all you need is the right equipment and
        research.</p>

      <p>Research really is the absolute most important aspect to home brewing. You will find literally
        thousands of guides online that will walk you through every step of the way, and there are
        plenty of forums where you can discuss the hobby with other enthusiasts, who will be more than
        happy to share their experiences and advice.</p>

      <p>Adequate research can help to save money in the long run as well, as you can seek advice on the

      <p>After you’ve found a guide to help you through the ins and outs of beer making, you’re going to
        want to keep a brewing log. No matter how simple the recipe, you need to keep track of exactly
        what went in for a number of reasons.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <p>Firstly, it gives you the opportunity to tweak your recipes to make them perfect (it’s said that
        even if your first batch is decent, it will take until after your tenth to really get it right),
        you can make this easy on yourself by labelling beers, so you have a clear reference in your
        brewing log.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <p>And secondly, keeping track of everything in a brewing log will be invaluable should you want to
        take the step up from brewing for yourself to eventually selling your beer.</p>

      <p>Once you’ve settled on your favourite beer, and you’ve nailed the production stage, you’re going
        to be hugely proud and might want to start thinking of the next logical step. You need to ask
        yourself – do you want to keep it all to yourself and your loved ones? Or maybe, do you consider
        scaling up and selling it on?</p>
      <p>The first step is to decide on a fitting name for your beer, and then start bottling it and
        labelling it. You can opt for a flip-top cap, as these are reusable but expensive, or you could
        go for the traditional crown cork bottle top, these will need a bottle capping machine, or screw
        top bottles.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>For your first homebrew batch you can use the same glass bottles over and over again. This saves money on
    resources and energy, and then once you begin selling on a small scale, you could introduce a reward
    scheme for customers who return their bottles. However, things change when you want to start supplying
    shops and renting brewery space. In essence everything here hugely depends on how large a scale you want
    to take your beer making.</p>
  <h2 class="headingPost">Licensing requirements</h2>
  <p><img src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>b-5.jpg" class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-sm-12"></p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 col-sm-6">
      <p>The size of your operation greatly affects the legality of home brewing as well. If you want to
        sell your own beer, the 2003 Licensing Act states that the sale of alcohol requires you to have
        a license. And wherever you make your beer will come under food standards trading requirements
        and be subject to inspections form the Food Standards Agency (FSA).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <p>Throughout the UK, the sale of alcohol is restricted, and your local authority must license any
        premises selling it. You can find your local authority here. The rules and regulations vary
        greatly depending on where the alcohol is being sold, and as a brewer you will really need to do
        your homework in order to adhere to the strict laws in place, as well as correctly pay your
        taxes.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <p>Beer Duty tax is chargeable on any beer that has an alcoholic strength of over 1.2% alcohol by
        volume (ABV), and if you’re producing beer for commercial reason, then you must <a href="#">register
        as a brewer with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)</a>. Once registered you must keep specific
        records and accounts of all income and expenses, and calculate any Beer Duty that is due, and
        pay that tax.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <p>With a whole lot of skill, patience, hard work and research, you can certainly make some money
        from brewing and selling your own beer. It’s an immensely satisfying hobby, and one that, if
        done right, could potentially lead to an exciting new career possibility.</p>
