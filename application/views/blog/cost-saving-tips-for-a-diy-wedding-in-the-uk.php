      <p>Your wedding day is going to be one of the most enjoyable experiences you’re ever likely to have, but
        unfortunately, as more and more details emerge during the planning phase, it’s going to turn out to be
        one of the most stressful (and expensive) things to do as well.</p>
      <p>When making plans it’s all too easy to get over-excited in creating the most fantastical wedding
        imaginable, but the reality of it is, unless you’re super rich, you’re going to want to keep the cost
        down as much as possible.</p>
      <p>So first things first, you need to establish a set budget and stick to it. Don’t fall into the trap of
        not doing this straight away, as the costs can quickly get away from you.</p>

          <h2 class="headingPost">A few money-saving tips</h2>
          <p>Avoid relying on dedicated wedding suppliers for goods and services – they tend to know that they
            have a captive market, and as such they will push prices way up. At the end of the day there’s a
            lot that you can do yourself for half the cost.</p>

      <p>There’s plenty you can do to DIY your wedding day, but it’s also important to be realistic about what you
        can and can’t achieve. However good it feels to do things yourself, the time spent sourcing everything
        and making things will soon add up.</p>
      <p>A good idea to begin with is to trim down your guest list; this can help you save money on absolutely
        everything. If you’re just catering for your nearest and dearest, you’ll also have a much more intimate
        occasion, and one where you’ll actually have time to talk to as well as thank everyone for being
        there.</p>
      <p>Try and keep your eyes peeled for some value for money solutions to your wedding favours. You can buy
        little boxes in bulk on popular web auction sites, and <a href="#">bespoke labels can be bought
        separately</a> to add a personal touch. What you put in them is up to you, but it could be something
        as simple as your favourite chocolate or teabag.</p>

          <h2 class="headingPost">The time and place</h2>
          <p>If you’re looking to save money, do not get married on a Saturday, this is a prime day for most
            venues, which will charge accordingly. Also, look to get married towards the end of the peak
            season of spring and summer, or even off-season entirely. Besides, a winter wedding has it’s own
            unique charm.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>A long engagement means that you can book a venue long in advance. This is perfect because the cost will
        always increase as venues look to fill competitive dates. While you’re at it, think about having the
        ceremony and reception at the same place – this cuts down on travel time for any vendors you might
        use.</p>
      <p>In terms of the venue itself, maybe look for those who don’t require you to use all of their own
        services. Hotels are notoriously bad for this, as they usually insist that all food and drink goes
        through them, which is typically quite expensive.</p>
      <p>Choosing a venue that has it’s own beautiful features won’t need much decorating, and if you were to
        choose having your wedding in December then it may already look beautiful with all the festive
        decorations.</p>
      <p>In terms of the venue itself, maybe look for those who don’t require you to use all of their own

        through them, which is typically quite expensive.</p>
      <p>Decorating needn’t be expensive. Try using greenery and shrubs instead of traditional flowers, swap out
        costly bouquets for less expensive ones and stick to just one or two types of flower (it helps if they
        are in season as well). You could also simply opt for non-florals such as lanterns.</p>

          <h2 class="headingPost">The dress</h2>
          <p>As much as we all dream of that fairy-tale dress, it doesn’t have to cost a fortune. Plenty of
            high street stores sell their own wedding dresses at a fraction of the cost of dedicated
            dressmakers – Monsoon for example have a lovely range for under £200. Another option is to look
            at charity shops, such as Oxfam, who often sell second-hand dresses that have only been worn
            once.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="clear10"></div>
      <p>You can always keep an eye on the sales as well to pick up a bargain. Find out the dates of sample and
        designer sales; you could make savings of up to 70% on dresses, veils, shoes and headpieces.</p>

          <h2 class="headingPost">Food and drink</h2>
          <p>To save money on the food, you could choose to not have a sit-down meal, and instead look at
            alternatives such as hog roasts and barbeques or a baked potato bar with all the trimmings. You
            could even incorporate it in to an overall theme for a ‘country-chic’ wedding.</p>
          <p>Don’t feel like you have to have a wedding cake either. This is often an overly expensive option
            that has room for inventive alternatives such as mini pies, a cookie and milk station, and
            muffins or cupcakes.</p>
          <p>The same goes for the booze. You don’t have to offer endless alcohol options. Beer and wine is
            fine, and if you buy in bulk, it helps to lessen the cost.</p>

          <p>You don’t have to go it alone in the quest for keeping things as cheap as possible, everyone you
            know will be more than happy to lend a hand when they can. Maybe you could ask you dad to drive
            you to the wedding for old time’s sake? And there’s bound to be someone you know who would be
            willing to whip up a cake? Perhaps you could get people together who could help to make the
            decorations? Not only does this all save money, but it also gets those close to you more
            involved in the big day, making it that little bit more personal as well.</p>

      <p>While you’re at it, is there anybody you know who would be happy to be the DJ for the night?</p>
      <p>Similarly, there must be a budding photographer out there who would be happy to do their share of the photos for the day. If not, you can save money by supplying tables with disposable cameras to get some fun candid shots, or you could get everyone to upload their own photos of the day onto a social media site, or get them to email them to you.</p>
      <p>Whatever it is, don’t be afraid to ask others for help – most people will be flattered that you want them involved in your big day.</p>
