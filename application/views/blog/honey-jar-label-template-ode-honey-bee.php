  <p>Labelling your honey jars can be a pain or it can be a labour of love! Whichever it is for you, I wanted
    to provide an alternative that may make it easier for you. So I teamed up with a designer (thanks Rich!)
    who came up with the label design you can see above. With the wonders of technology <strong>you can edit
    and print this design for use on your own honey jars</strong>.</p>
  <p>The label template set includes designs for the jar itself and the lid too. Both are editable, as shown
    below:</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>jar02-editable-parts.png"><img
                            class="img-responsive col-xs-12"
                            alt="The arrows show which parts of the label template can be edited"
                            src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>jar02-editable-parts.png"></a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The design sticks to traditional amber/yellow colours often associated with honey labelling. Subtle
    hexagonal shapes make up the background while nature makes its appearance with the daisies and of course
    the bees. The word ‘Honey’ is appropriately penned as if written with honey – golden, thick and
    dripping. The editable text is given a rustic feel as if written on yourself.</p>
  <p><strong>Label Template Types:</strong></p>
  <p>There are four templates you can download. Two for the jar, two for the lid. The two types are called
    ‘autofill’ and ‘fillable’.</p>
  <p><strong>Autofill</strong>: When you edit the text in a field it automatically fills in the corresponding
    field across the whole template. This saves time if you want all the labels the same but you can’t have
    different text in each of the labels. That’s why you might sometimes want a fillable template.</p>
  <p><strong>Fillable</strong>: With this template you can enter different text for each label.</p>

  <h2 id="buy">Buying Labels for These Templates</h2>
  <p>These templates are designed to work with the following size labels:</p>
  <p>For the jar: <a href="http://localhost/a4-sheets/oval/t84/" target="_blank">AAV010 75mm x 55mm oval used
    as jar labels</a></p>
  <p>For the lid: <a href="http://localhost/a4-sheets/circular/t248/" target="_blank">AACX12 64mm diameter
    used as lid labels</a></p>
  <p>Use a plain white label or a white gloss label to give it a shinier look! Don’t forget you can even use a
    peelable label if you want to re-use the jar.</p>
  <p>If you have a design you want printed, see our <a href="http://localhost/printed-labels/"
                                                                 target="_blank">custom label printing</a> service or

  <p><strong id="designer">Here’s our designer’s take on it (written while watching The Great British Bake
    Off):</strong></p>
  <p>Here in Blighty, we’re in the middle of the wettest decade in over a hundred years. From drizzle to
    downpoor – we’ve been treated to more rain than we know what to do with.</p>
  <p>But this is good! Do you know what rain brings?</p>
  <p>Together with it’s friend sunshine, rain brings growth! They team up to give us flourishing fauna,
    plentiful pastures and verdant verges all abundant with colour, life and vitality.</p>
  <p>Daffodils, daisies, dalias. Sunflowers, strawberries, snowdrops. They all love a bit of rain and
    sunshine. But they’d be nowhere without an extra added ingredient. That little spark that really gets
    things ticking.</p>
  <p>The humble bee.</p>
  <p>That tireless worker clad in black and yellow, she slaves away night and day pollenating our countryside,
    spreading the love between one flower and its blossoming love on the other side of the meadow.</p>
  <p>So, Miss Bee – we thank you for this. Without you, we’d be without some of the most beautiful sights
    nature has to offer.<br>
    But this isn’t why I love you. I love you for that byproduct of all your graft. The fruits of your
    labour. That gold you work so hard for. YOUR HONEY!</p>
  <p>MMMM HONEY. Liquid gold, spread on a bit of toast. Stirred into the morning porridge, bringing flavour to
    that plainest of staple. A cheeky spoon into the mouth when no one is looking – absolutely impossible to
    do without that involuntary grin spreading across the face.</p>
  <p>So here’s to the Bee. God bless you, you wonderful little creature!</p>
