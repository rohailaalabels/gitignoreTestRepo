      <h2 class="headingPost">LABELS FOR ROLL LABEL PRINTERS</h2>
      <p>For those new to or inexperienced in the ordering of plain labels for roll label printers this
        article is intended to help with some key issues and ensure that the correct label material and size
        are ordered, the diameter of the label roll/s fit in the printer and that the printer sensors can
        detect the labels to be printed.</p>
      <h2 class="headingPost">PRINTERS</h2>
      <p>There are currently two types of printers manufactured specifically for the printing of pre-cut
        labels, which are Inkjet and Thermal printer technologies. There are some Laser (dry toner) printers
        for the printing of rolls as well as flat sheet format, but these are pre-conversion, reel-to-reel
        format and not for post conversion, pre-cut labels.</p>
      <h2 class="headingPost">Inkjet Printers</h2>
      <p>This technology produces image and text on the labels using aqueous ink in a dye or pigment format.
        Since their introduction in the latter-half of the 1980’s, inkjet printers have grown in popularity
        and performance.<br>

      <p>An inkjet label printer is any printer that places extremely small droplets of ink onto a paper or
        Polymer label to create an image. The dots of ink are extremely small (in desktop printers, usually
        between 50 and 60 microns in diameter), so small that they are less than the diameter of a human
        hair (80 microns). The amount of ink dispensed by the print heads is measured in Picolitres (1
        Trillionth of a litre) and in larger commercial inkjet printers the number of Picolitres dispensed
        varies by printhead nozzle, typically from 6 – 11 Picolitres, but in desktop printers the printhead
        nozzles are commonly a standard 75 microns. This enables a very precise positioning of ink dots,
        with resolutions of up to 1,440 x 720 dots per inch (DPI). The dots deposited from the ink
        cartridges are typically CMYK in desktop printers and combine colours together in varying quantities
        of these minute dots to create photo-quality images.</p>

      <p>Inks are either dye based which consist of a colourant that is fully dissolved and suspended in
        liquid or a pigment ink which consists of a very fine powder of solid colourant particles suspended
        in a liquid carrier. The main difference between dyes and pigments is the particle size and
        therefore dyes are not UV stable whereas pigments are usually UV stable.</p>
      <h2 class="headingPost">Label Materials for Inkjet Printers</h2>
      <p>Because inkjet printers dispense wet ink onto the label surface (face-stock) the ink requires time to
        dry through surface absorption and evaporation. Plain label face-stocks, with absorption
        capabilities therefore work best with inkjet printers i.e. uncoated matt papers.</p>
      <p>Coated papers, such as semi-gloss, gloss and high gloss, along with Polymers will generally not work
        well with desktop inkjet printers as the surface coating in the case of paper and the material
        composition of Polymers will prevent absorption and without heated dryer’s in the printer,
        evaporation will not compensate. Leaving the printed labels at risk of smudging as they emerge from
        the printer.</p>
      <p>The solution is to coat the gloss finish papers and Polymers with a chemical that reacts with the ink
        and dries the ink. Therefore, when selecting a paper label with a gloss finish or a Polymer label
        i.e. Polyester, Polyethylene or Polypropylene always be sure that there is an “Inkjet” version of
        the label material available.</p>

    <h3 class="headingPost">Thermal Printers</h3>
    <p>This is a digital printing process which produces a printed image via a heated print-head either applied
      directly to the paper or Polymer label face-stock, which has been coated with a thermochromic chemical,
      or by applying heat from the print-head to a resin and/or wax ribbon which then deposits residue from
      the ribbon onto the label.</p>
    <p>Many thermal printers will work in both modes i.e. as a direct and thermal transfer printer, providing
      that a ribbon has been loaded and these dual functionality models tend to commonly use the letter “T” at
      the end of the model number to denote that there is also a thermal transfer mode e.g. Zebra GK240D
      (Direct-Thermal mode only) &amp; GK420T (Direct-Thermal &amp; Thermal-Transfer modes).</p>
    <h3 class="headingPost">Direct Thermal Printing</h3>
    <p>Direct thermal printers use a chemically treated label material (paper and Polymer) that blackens when
      the thermal print-head applies heat to its surface.<br>

    <p><strong>Brief Summary</strong></p>
    <ul class="ribbon_li">
      <li>Requires no ink, toner, or ribbons.</li>
      <li>Prints in black only.</li>
      <li>Sensitive to UV light and age will fade the printed image.</li>
      <li>Cost effective and cheaper than Thermal Transfer because there are no additional consumables
        (ribbons). </li>
      <li>Minimal maintenance required or replacement of consumables.</li>
      <li>Not recommended for high-contact use.</li>
      <li>Commonly used for short-life barcode and variable data applications such as address labels, barcode
        labels, delivery labels, name-tag labels, pricing labels, receipt labels, shipping labels etc. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because heat is used to create the image, by heating the thermal sensitive coating, direct thermal
      printers don’t require ink, toner, or ribbons. An advantage of this technology is low maintenance costs,
      as with relatively few moving parts, there is theoretically less to require maintenance and/or
      replacement and also easy to operate and use.</p>
    <p>However, while the foregoing can be interpreted as benefits this printing technology is not without some
      constraints. Mainly that the image is not permanent and will fade over a period of time. Because the
      paper is heat-sensitive, additional heat or excessive light can cause the entire paper to darken,
      rendering any text unreadable and barcodes non-scannable. For this reason, direct thermal printing is
      mainly used for labels with a limited period of usage i.e. POS, delivery and shipping labels etc.
      Another consideration is that the image and text created is black, but coloured branding and graphics
      can of course be pre-printed leaving only the variable data and/or information to be printed in black on
      a white or coloured background.</p>
    <h3 class="headingPost">Thermal Paper</h3>
    <p>These papers for use in Direct-Thermal printers are produced to provide rich, legible image and text at
      all print speeds for excellent readability.</p>
    <p>The surface of the paper is coated with a solid-state mixture of a dye and a suitable matrix. The coating
      includes four different types of chemicals:</p>
    <h4 class="blackheading">Leuco Dyes</h4>
    <p>These can be in two chemical forms, one of which is colourless. The dyes used in thermal paper are
      usually Triaryl Methane Phthalide (TMP) dyes or Fluorian dyes or Crystal Violet lactone. These dyes have
      a colourless Leuco (white or lacking colour) form when crystalline or when in a pH neutral environment,
      but become coloured upon melting or when exposed to an acidic environment.</p>
    <h4 class="blackheading">Developers</h4>
    <p>Developers are basically organic acids which are also melted along with Leuco dyes in order to provide
      more colour. Examples of such developers include Phenols, Sulfonyl Urea’s and Zinc salts of substituted
      Salicylic acids.</p>
    <h4 class="blackheading">Sensitizers</h4>
    <p>Sensitizers are also added to the paper surface to optimize the colourisation temperature and to
      facilitate mixing of developers and Leuco dyes upon melting. Sensitizers are commonly simple Ether
      molecules.</p>
    <h4 class="blackheading">Stabilizers</h4>
    <p>Stabilizers are added to the layer of glaze formed by the Leuco dye, developer and sensitiser and prevent
      the dyes from returning to their original colourless, crystalline forms when stored in hot or humid
      conditions.</p>
    <p>In addition to the thermochromic coating explained above thermal papers can also have protective coatings
      over this to protect against abrasion (the heat generated from which is sufficient to darken the paper),
      grease and oils from foodstuffs. This is called a “top coat” and provides improved resistance and
      protection to the label and the printed information.</p>

      <strong>Brief Summary</strong></p>
    <ul class="ribbon_li">
      <li>Ribbon required for printing</li>
      <li>Different colour ribbons provide colour options</li>
      <li>The printed image should not age and fade</li>
      <li>The wax and/or resin image is usually durable and resistant to chemicals and temperature.</li>
      <li>Good reproductive quality</li>
      <li>Compatible with a large range of label face-stocks</li>
      <li>Commonly used for product ID’s, asset and inventory labels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because environmental factors will not alter the print quality, this type of technology is known to
      create a very strong printed area that should withstand extreme temperatures and contact with chemicals.
      This print method is recommended for labels that need to last longer than six months.</p>
    <p>In contrast to Direct Thermal printing Thermal Transfer printing provides the ability to use spot-colours
      via the change of ribbon. Because the label face-stock does not require a pre-coated surface like Direct
      Thermal this print method is also very versatile in terms of the label materials that can be used.</p>

    <h2 class="headingPost">LABEL SENSORS</h2>
    <p>There are two main types of sensors currently used in roll label printers to detect the beginning and end
      of the labels. Which are optical or photoelectrical sensors able to detect changes in opacity and/or
      contrast and capacitive or ultrasonic sensors that detect changes in thickness between the label and the
      roll backing.</p>
    <h3 class="headingPost">Optical/Photoelectrical Sensors</h3>
    <p>Optical or photoelectrical sensors are very versatile non-contact sensing devices. The reliability of
      photoelectric “eyes” or “sensors” took a giant leap forward in the early 1970s when the light emitting
      diode (LED) replaced the fragile incandescent light source.</p>
    <p>This solid-state light source also enables the elimination of most problems previously caused by ambient
      room light. Modern pulse modulated photoelectric sensors respond only to the light emitted by their own
      light source.<br>
      This capability allows the sensor to be very sensitive and responsive to small light changes that occur
      to the light beam path between the light source lens and the receiving lens.<br>
      For an object to be detected, it must affect the intensity of the light beam reaching the sensor’s light
      detector in one of two ways:</p>
    <p>The object must break or diminish an existing light beam path between the light source lens and receiver
      lens — <strong>Beam Break</strong> mode.<br>
      <img class="img-responsive aligncenter size-full wp-image-1833"
                     src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>beam1.png" alt="" width="266" height="124"><br>
      The object itself must diffuse or reflect the light beam to the receiving lens — <strong>Beam
      Make</strong> mode.<br>
      <img class="img-responsive aligncenter size-full wp-image-1834"
                     src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>beam2.png" alt="" width="264" height="109"></p>
    <h4 class="blackheading">Gap Sensors</h4>
    <p>Gap sensors are an excellent choice to sense a distinguishing change or object on a continuous web or
      roll of label materials. By using opacity mode sensing techniques that utilise a light source capable of
      penetrating through the web of materials, gap sensors can register slight contrasting light level
      changes and produce an output signal for a specific machine operation.<br>
      <img class="img-responsive aligncenter size-full wp-image-1836"
                     src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>gap.png" alt="" width="673" height="289"
                     srcset="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>gap.png 673w, <?=BLOG_ASSETS?>gap-300x129.png 300w"
                     sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px"><br>
      A significant advantage of opacity mode sensing with gap sensors is that end users do not need to be
      concerned with web flutter or ambient light, including strobe flashes. Depending on what you are trying
      to sense, opacity mode sensors can give you the desired output signal to perform machine functions.
      Typical applications include sensing labels on a roll, sensing registration marks on printed packaging
      material, and splice detection on continuous webs of material.</p>
    <p>Since opacity mode sensing distinguishes the light level change as light passes through a web of
      material, the web must be translucent or transparent. Most webs of packaging material such as film,
      metallized films, and paper do allow light to pass through. Opaque materials such as aluminium foil does
      not allow light to pass through and, therefore, cannot be used in opacity mode sensing.<br>
      The different sensing options involved are all optical. They can either detect a gap, a hole or a
      black-block line that is printed for the sole purpose of sensing. These are required to trigger the
      start of each label and printing within the set print area of the label. If these are not correctly set
      it will cause printer error or incorrect print placement.</p>
    <h4 class="blackheading">Label Gap</h4>
    <p>Between each die cut label, the waste material is typically stripped away leaving behind what is called a
      “label gap.” The carrier or liner supporting the label is usually less opaque than the label and liner
      together. Special transmissive sensors read the opacity changes where one label ends and a new label
      begins. Label gaps are commonly 2mm – 3mm but can also vary due to automatic label application equipment
      and additions such as perforations between labels.<br>
      If there is not enough contrast between a label and its liner, then either not enough light will pass
      through for the printer to find its “top-of-form” or in the case of transparent labels too much light
      may pass through the label. Sometimes you can recalibrate the sensors to adjust to a new liner;
      otherwise you will have to choose another way to detect the labels.</p>
    <h4 class="blackheading">Slot or Notch</h4>
    <p>To create more contrast, you may need slots or side notches cut in the liner. Before deciding whether to
      use slots or notches, you will need to determine whether your sensors are “fixed” and locked into one
      position in your printer or if they are “movable.” Fixed sensors are commonly located either to read the
      very edge of a label roll or in the centre. Movable sensors can be located anywhere across the web to
      give you much more flexibility as to where you can locate your cut outs.<br>
      <img class="img-responsive aligncenter size-full wp-image-1837"
                     src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>fig.png" alt="" width="783" height="375"
                     srcset="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>fig.png 783w, <?=BLOG_ASSETS?>fig-300x144.png 300w, <?=BLOG_ASSETS?>fig-768x368.png 768w"
                     sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></p>
    <p>Sensing slots are narrow oval holes often centred in the liner between labels as shown in Fig. 01 above
      and usually require larger-than-normal label gaps. Because trying to cut and remove a tiny slot from a
      normal 2mm – 3mm gap is difficult, especially if you also have perforations between labels.</p>
    <p>Sensing notches are cut out at the edge of the liner as shown in Fig. 02 above and may not require a
      larger gap. Not only are notches used with labels on brown or highly opaque liners, but also when
      working with tag materials that have no liner or label gap. This explains why you often see hang tags
      with perforations between each tag and four rounded corners that create those notches.</p>
    <p>The size, shape and location of a sensing slot or notch is dependent on your printer specifications.
      Slots and notches typically require special cutting tools. Subject to the size of your label gap, you
      may also need a new label tool which adds to your initial investment but if this is your printer sensor
      requirement, it will make your label printing much easier.</p>
    <h4 class="blackheading">Black-Block Mark</h4>
    <p>Some label printers may also have a “reflective” sensor that relies on black-block registration lines or
      marks printed on the back of the label liner. The width of the black mark is synchronized with the label
      size to tell the printer when to print label to label. Black marks are particularly useful when labels
      or tags are “butt cut” and separated only by a perforation or face cut. Since we will have to print the
      black marks for you, this sensor method does add to the cost of supply.<br>
      <img class="img-responsive aligncenter size-full wp-image-1840"
                     src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>liner.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="314"
                     srcset="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>liner.jpg 291w, <?=BLOG_ASSETS?>liner-278x300.jpg 278w"
                     sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px"><br>
      NOTE: Black marks, sensing slots or notches are usually necessary when printing clear labels where there
      is absolutely no contrast between the labels and liner.</p>
    <p>Other examples of black-block registration marks on the back of the label liner material:<br>
      <img class="img-responsive aligncenter size-full wp-image-1842"
                     src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>Screenshot_1.png" alt="" width="570" height="380"

                     sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px"></p>
    <h4 class="blackheading">None</h4>
    <p>The requirement for no means of label detection e.g. gap, slot, notch or line, is only associated with
      continuous media, often referred to as “continuous roll” printing. Which is a non-converted/cut label
      material printed upon <span style="color: #fd4913;">first</span> and cut to label size subsequently. In
      this format the printer sensor will only be used to detect the beginning and end of the roll, it will
      not determine the print area which can therefore be variable with the print for different label sizes
      being produced on the same roll.</p>
    <p>If your printer requires a black-block registration mark you can select this option when ordering labels
      online.<br>

    <h3 class="headingPost">Capacitive &amp; Ultrasonic Sensors</h3>
    <p>These new generation sensors use capacitive or ultrasonic technology, both of which are optics-free to
      measure distance and detect differences in the label height relative to the backing liner and therefore
      detect labels that optical sensors cannot i.e. clear labels on a clear liner or opaque labels on an
      opaque liner.<br>
      Sensors engineered using capacitive or ultrasonic technology have no sensitivity to colour or contrast
      This improved sensor technology in label printers also makes the process faster and even more accurate. </p>
    <h3 class="headingPost">How A Clear Label Sensor Works</h3>
    <h4 class="blackheading">Capacitive Clear Label Sensing</h4>
    <p>Capacitive sensors use an electric field to sense the amount of material in the sensor. The electric
      field exists in the gap between a sensing element in the top of the sensor and the grounded baseplate of
      the sensor. Web material placed in that gap changes the way the electric field behaves — more material
      changes it more. The electronics in the clear label sensor can sense these changes in the electric field
      and this makes capacitive label sensors the most precise label sensors on the market.</p>
    <h4 class="blackheading">Differential Capacitive Clear Label Sensors</h4>
    <p>Differential sensing is achieved by using two sensing elements in the top of the sensor creating electric
      fields to the baseplate. When a label is in the sensor, both electric fields behave the same. When a gap
      enters the sensor, one of the electric fields over the gap changes but the other doesn’t. The sensor
      electronics detect this difference and signal the presence of a label to the print controller. This type
      of sensor only sees changes in thickness. For this reason, the sensor rarely needs adjustment because it
      doesn’t care if the label is thick or thin — it only sees the changes.</p>
    <p>Because of the way metallic materials interact with electric fields, if metallic artwork such as a foil
      logo enters the sensor, the sensor sees many differences between the two sensing elements as the artwork
      travels through the sensor. For this reason, labels using any metallic materials require a different
      sensing approach as set-out in the single-ended sensor version explained below. <img
                        class="img-responsive aligncenter size-full wp-image-1847"

    <h4 class="blackheading">Single-Ended Capacitive Clear Label Sensors</h4>
    <p>As the title above suggests this type of capacitive sensor has only one sensing element. It measures the
      absolute thickness of the material in the sensor. This type of sensor is more likely to require an
      adjustment between different labels in order to set the initial thickness measurement. After that, the
      sensor triggers the controller when the thickness exceeds a certain point; this point is set to trigger
      when the additional label thickness is added to the liner thickness. Once the thickness exceeds the trip
      point, any metallic material is ignored by the sensor because it only makes the label look thicker, but
      the sensor has already triggered. </p>

    <h4 class="blackheading">Ultrasonic Clear Label Sensors</h4>
    <p>Ultrasonic sensing works much like single-ended capacitive sensing except instead of an electric field,
      it uses high-frequency sound energy. A transmitting transducer (“speaker”) in the base of the sensor
      transmits sound to a receiving transducer (“microphone”) in the top of the sensor. The label web reduces
      the amount of sound reaching the receiver. The thicker the web, the less sound at the receiver. The
      sensor electronics measure the sound pressure at the receiver and triggers the control when a label edge
      is detected. This technology has no sensitivity to metallic materials.<br>

      This is the latest application of technology and type of clear label sensor, but not necessarily the
      most reliably accurate for high speed printing, although accuracy is measured in parts of a millimetre.
      See the summary analysis below for more details.</p>
    <h3 class="headingPost">Clear Label Sensors &amp; Print/Application Speeds</h3>
    <p>Label sensor performance is a measurement of how accurately the sensor detects the edge of the label and
      how that accuracy is affected by speed. Label sensor performance is one consideration in determining
      which printer and sensor is best for your printing requirements.<br>
      Similarly, when used with automatic label application equipment, how accurately a label is located on a
      product and/or package is determined by many other factors like the mechanics of the machine and the
      other sensors responsible for detecting the package position. But label placement accuracy will never be
      better than the label sensor’s ability to accurately locate the label edge.</p>
    <h3 class="headingPost">Overview</h3>
    <p>Capacitive label sensors are far faster and more accurate than any other label sensor technology
      regardless of whether the label is clear or not clear.<br>
      The charts below show the label location (registration) of 240 consecutive labels as detected by
      different technology sensors. A single bar down the centre of each chart indicates all 240 labels were
      accurately placed within ±.0.05 mm. Other bars indicate how many label placements varied (how tall the
      bar is) and how far they varied (how far the bars are from the centre of the chart).<br>

    <h4 class="blackheading">Optical Sensors</h4>
    <p>Optical sensors are perfectly accurate at low speeds. At higher speeds, their accuracy degrades a small
      amount. Optical sensors cannot detect clear labels. Choose a roll label printer with this type of sensor
      if you never use clear labels, or are going to use black-block registration marks.</p>

    <h4 class="blackheading">Differential Capacitive Sensors</h4>
    <p>Capacitive label sensors are extremely accurate at all speeds and differential capacitive sensors have
      extremely stable setups and require little adjustment.<br>
      Any metallic inks or other metallic materials will interfere with the sensor’s performance and black
      inks with a high carbon content can also be a problem.<br>
      Choose a roll label printer with this sensor technology if accuracy is important and if you use clear
      labels but never labels with any metallic materials or metallic inks. </p>

    <h4 class="blackheading">Ultrasonic Label Sensors</h4>
    <p>Ultrasonic sensors have a great advantage of detecting the broadest range of materials. But they are the
      least accurate of all label sensor technologies. Their accuracy is directly related to web speed and
      accuracy continually, although minimally decreases as speed increases.<br>
      Choose a roll label printer with ultrasonic sensor technology when you want to be sure you can detect
      any type of label and you can tolerate the registration inaccuracies, especially at higher speeds.</p>

    <h2 class="headingPost">LABEL ROLL – CORE SIZE</h2>
    <p>The roll label core is a cardboard like spool that the labels are wound wrapped around so. they can be
      mounted and fed through your label printer. When shopping for labels on a roll you will need to check
      the exact core size, or range of core sizes applicable for your label printer.<br>
      <img class="img-responsive aligncenter size-full wp-image-1860"

                     sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px"><br>
      At AA Labels we have a range of 4 common and standard core sizes to select from:</p>
    <p>25mm (1”)<br>
      38mm (1½”)<br>
      44.5mm (1¾”)<br>
      76mm (3”)</p>
    <p>When ordering your labels on rolls via our website upon selecting the shape and size of your labels you
      will then need to select the label material that you want (Fig. 01) and at this point you will be asked
      to select a “core size” before proceeding (Fig. 02).<br>
      <img class="img-responsive aligncenter size-full wp-image-1861"

      Once you have selected the roll core size suitable for your printer from the drop-down options available
      you can then browse the material options available by scrolling the page or refine your search using the
      on-page filter at the top of the page (Figs 03 &amp; 04).<br>

    <p>Once you have specified the label shape, dimensions and material you are ready to proceed to enter the
      number of labels required and obtain a price.</p>
    <h2 class="headingPost">LABEL ROLL – OUTER DIAMETER</h2>
    <p>Each roll has a recommended maximum quantity of labels per roll based on the roll core size selected, the
      label size and the compactness and rigidity of the finished roll size. You will also need to specify the
      number of labels per roll and the number of rolls based on the quantity of labels required and the
      multiple of rolls produced.</p>
    <p>For example, a 60mm circular label is produced 4 across on the convertor and slit into 4 rolls and is
      therefore available to order only in multiples of 4. If the total requirement for this label was 1,000
      then you would enter 250 labels per roll and a multiple of 4 rolls (the multiple is always shown for
      guidance) as shown below (Fig. 05).<br>
      <img src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>fig05-1.png" alt="" width="996" height="961"

    <p class="wp-caption-text">Fig. 05</p>
    <p>At this point having entered the quantity you will receive information on the roll diameter as also shown
      above (Fig. 05) and it is important to check with your printer data sheet or user manual that the
      overall roll diameter does not exceed the size of roll that can be used in the printer.</p>
    <h2 class="headingPost">SEARCH BY THERMAL PRINTER</h2>
    <p>If you are buying labels for use with a thermal printer (Direct Thermal and/or Thermal Transfer) there is
      also a specific search function on the website for this, which can be found in the main menu at the top
      of the page (Fig. 06).<br>
      <img src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>fig06-1.png" alt="" width="1004" height="951"

    <p class="wp-caption-text">Fig. 06</p>
    <p>From the drop-down menu that opens with a mouse-over function, select “Search by Thermal Printer Model”
      under the heading “Labels on Rolls” (Fig. 07).<br>
      <img class="img-responsive aligncenter size-full wp-image-1868"
                     src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>fig07.png" alt="" width="1009" height="863"

    <p class="wp-caption-text">Fig. 08</p>
    <p>By selecting and clicking on a printer model manufacturer and selecting the printer that you require
      labels for will provide you with useful information such as the roll core size required and the maximum
      roll diameter for the printer, along with the maximum label and print width and access to downloadable
      versions of the Product/Technical Data Sheet and User Manual (Fig. 09).<br>

    <p class="wp-caption-text">Fig. 09</p>
    <p>You can then use the Label Filter shown above to select the label shape and size and proceed as
      previously described to select the label material, quantity of labels and the number of rolls.</p>
    <h2 class="headingPost">PRINTER COMPATIBILITY</h2>
    <p>When searching by the Thermal Printer route to label selection the printer compatibility will be shown in
      the summary at the top of the page (Fig. 09) but in all circumstances the various search methods will
      converge upon the materials page where there is another printer compatibility check available via the
      on-page printer icons (Fig. 10).<br>
      <img src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>fig10-1.png" alt="" width="996" height="729"

    <p class="wp-caption-text">Fig. 10</p>
    <h2 class="headingPost">THE PROTECTION OF LABEL ROLLS IN TRANSIT</h2>
    <p>Fulfilment of roll label orders always involves the secure packing and protection of the rolls to
      minimise movement in transit and the potential for abrasion to the surface of the labels. Which is
      important for all labels whether plain or printed, but particularly so when transporting labels with a
      Thermochromic coating for use with Direct Thermal printers as any contact risks resultant black marks on
      the labels surface from the heat generated in friction.</p>
    <p>Therefore, to mitigate against this outcome all labels on rolls are despatched for delivery with
      additional labels to the quantity ordered on the outside of the roll (one revolution). So that in the
      event that the outer labels incur scuff-marks these can simply be taken off and discarded.</p>
    <h2 class="headingPost">ASSISTANCE &amp; INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>Information about label size, type and printer compatibility can be found on the website within the
      “Labels for Thermal Printers” section, along with Product Data Sheets and User Manuals (Fig. 11) to
      assist problem solving.<br>
