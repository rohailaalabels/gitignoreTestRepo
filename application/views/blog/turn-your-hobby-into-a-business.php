  <p>When you're suddenly faced with some extra free time on your hands it can be an exciting, but sometimes
    daunting, experience. Whether your children have just started school, or you've quit your job to focus
    on some more me-time, it can be difficult to reclaim a sense of purpose away from your role as a parent
    or employee. </p>
  <p>Using your skills to create a business you love will allow you to take back a sense of independence that
    still provides you with the flexibility to fulfil your other commitments. Running a business you're
    passionate about, instantly provides more satisfaction than many other roles, plus you get all the
    benefits of being your own boss.</p>
  <p>In honor of National Hobby Month, you'll discover a series of blog posts over the upcoming weeks that
    will talk you through the best ways to get involved and get serious about your hobby! </p>

    <h2 class="headingPost">Pick a Hobby</h2>
    <div style="width:75%; float: left;">
      <p>Almost any hobby can be turned into a business as long as you're producing something that other
        people may want. That means making the most of your skills and being able to produce something
        that other people can't or don't' have the time to do. Think about the last time you had guests
        round, did they admire your homemade cushions or your clever storage solution in the kitchen?
        Everyone has a talent so identify the one that you enjoy the most, that you think will also be
        able to be taken to market. </p>

    <div style="width:75%; float: left;">
      <p>Now it's time to crunch numbers. Here you need to consider what materials you will need. If this
        is a long term hobby you might already be aware of these, but to build a successful business you
        will need to order them at a higher volume. The internet is full of resources and you may be
        able to get a discount if you buy in bulk. When you've determined how long it will take to make
        each product, you will be able to set a price. It's important to be realistic when setting your
        goals, especially at first, and as your customer base grows you'll be able to make more profit.
        Think of your business as a child, one that will grow and develop as you invest more time into
        it. It's important to be realistic when setting your goals, especially at first, and as your

    <h2 class="headingPost" >Where to advertise</h2>
    <div style="width:75%; float: left;">
      <p>The world of marketing can be intimidating, and it's easy to get caught up in a wealth of
        advertising strategies. It's important to maintain a balance, so that you have products to sell
        and crucially, people to sell them to. Using your local connections is a great start. Reach out
        to friends and ask them if they'd be interested in buying your product and if they could spread
        the news of your business. With your child starting school, it's a great opportunity to connect
        with other parents and gauge their interest. School events and fairs can also be a great way to
        earn more custom. It's important to be realistic when setting your goals, especially at first,
        and as your customer base grows you'll be able to make more profit. Think of your business as a
        child, one that will grow and develop as you invest more time into it.</p>

    <h2 class="headingPost">Selling online</h2>
    <div style="width:75%; float: left;">
      <p>Limiting your outreach to where you are based will also limit your custom, and by going online
        you can reach a larger group of people who are shopping for your product. Using an online
        marketplace such as Etsy, which is the go-to for hobbyists looking to make money from homemade
        items, takes the hassle out of selling products and does all the hard work for you. Simply add a
        photo and description and you're set! It's also worth mentioning the power of social networks.
        Consider setting up social media accounts to promote your business. Gaining shares will give you
        more exposure and potential for sales.</p>

    <h2 class="headingPost">Packaging</h2>
    <div style="width:75%; float: left;">
      <p>The appearance of your product is so important in making sales. You need to present your
        product so that it looks professional and attractive. It's the attention to detail here that
        will also make sure customers remember your brand and come back to purchase again and
        again. </p>
      <p>How often have you received a package so beautifully wrapped or with that personal extra
        touch that you've taken a picture and shown a friend? Investing the time into this from the
        start will help your business grow through referrals too. </p>
      <p>Consider attaching it to a beautiful label adorned with your logo and decorating with
        ribbons. Your label defines your brand and is crucial to your success. Take the time to
        design something using your logo and a clear description of the product, then get them
        printed onto a high quality plain label suitable for what you're applying it too. For
        example, if you're making jams that are best kept in the fridge you need to ensure the label
        remains sticky even when cold. You can find out more about picking labels by application <a

    <div style="width:75%; float: left;">
      <p>Once your business is up and running, you'll need to inform HMRC as you'll have to pay tax. As
        you'll be a sole trader, you need to register as self-employed within 3 months of making your
        first penny. The amount of tax you'll pay will depend on your earnings, but isn't a huge concern
        when you first start out as you'll pay the same amount as an employee, meaning you'll get a tax
        free allowance on earnings up to Â£10,600. </p>
      <p>Creating your own business from your hobby can be hard work, but it's worth the effort because of
        the freedom it provides you. By using quality materials and building a brand you are more likely
        to be successful in your new venture. </p>
