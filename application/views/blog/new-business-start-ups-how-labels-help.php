  <p>We are always happy to help new business start-ups and to know that we have assisted with label design
    services and advice. In the case of LMD it is a pleasure to observe their growth and progress, having
    initially provided advice on label design and studio services, we produced labels for the initial range
    of lip balm products. Following which they used our online Label Designer software available via the
    website, to design their own labels for the latest edition to the product range of foot balms.</p>

      <h2 class="headingPost">Label Designer </h2>
      <p>By using Label Designer the company was able to quickly design professional looking labels and
        order small test quantities for the prototype packaging and market testing.</p>
      <p>The company was so pleased with the outcome that they wrote a five star review of their
        experience on Trust Pilot an independent review website for online businesses.</p>

      <h2 class="headingPost">A Very Pleasant Experience!</h2>
      <p>After a long search and wasted money trying to get labels made for my new skincare range a chance
        referral led me to aalabels! The customer service experience was excellent, asked me what i
        wanted from the labels and talked me through the array of materials that would be suitable.
        samples came promptly and have been hooked since! Have made a couple of repeat orders and i have
        been very pleased with the results! I even had a turn at designing one myself using their label
        designer and can say i have been pleasantly surprised. This will be my one stop shop for my
        labelling need.</p>
      <p>LMD have now opened their online shop on lmdsbalms on <a href="http://www.lmdsbalms.etsy.com"> Etsy </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lmdsbalms/?fref=ts"> Facebook </a>and Instagram. </p>
