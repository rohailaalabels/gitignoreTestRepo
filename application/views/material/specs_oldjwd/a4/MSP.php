                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>Very popular  for labelling applications and branding of high value items where overprinting  of brand/logo on a silver background provides a pleasing aesthetic an enhances  the company and product image e.g. electrical items, white goods, bags and  cases etc. Also used as asset and information labels where label durability is  important and over-printing is required by laser or thermal transfer.</p>
                          <p>Ideal for A4 and cut-size applications, with good  removability, UV stability (non-yellowing) and water resistance once labelled.  Limited adhesion on very rough surfaces and not recommended for labelling PVC  substrates. </p>
<h3>Conversion &amp; printing</h3>
                          <p>Due to the  pre-treatment, the film is printable by common label printing methods like  letterpress, flexography, screen and offset as well as copier and laser toner  printers, but in all cases inks designed for non-absorbent materials should be  used.</p>
<h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The research  centre ISEGA (EN ISO 17025 accreditation for analytics and EN 45011 for  certification) has given the adhesive and approval according to the European  requirements for direct contact with dry and moist, non-fatty foodstuffs and  according to FDA regulations adhesive may come into direct contact with dry  foodstuffs, or it must be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional  barrier. Furthermore the adhesive may come into contact with poultry, dry  foodstuffs as well as fruit and vegetables.</p>
                          <p>The adhesive  is also in compliance with the demands of the Code of Federal Regulations, Food  &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) 21 CFR Ch. 01 (01.04.2012) 175.105 &amp;  175.125</p>
<h3 >Shelf Life</h3>
                          <p>From the  date of manufacture 2 years at 20° C and RH50%. Prolonged storage at higher  temperatures and/or humidity levels will shorten the shelf in optimum condition  terms.</p>
