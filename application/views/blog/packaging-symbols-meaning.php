  <p>There are hundreds of packaging symbols found on our everyday household goods, ranging from washing
    powder to make-up. These icons are essentially there to keep the user safe from harm and to stop
    spillages, improper storage or accidents from happening. Some are voluntary symbols but some are set out
    by law and a necessary part of your product packaging.</p>
  <p>But do consumers know the difference between these symbols, and do they actually understand the meaning
    of them?</p>
  <p>To find out, we surveyed a sample of the general public, with no prior manufacturing or packaging
    knowledge, and asked them to identify some symbols commonly found on packaging/labelling. The results
    were interesting!</p>
  <p>Out of the sample we surveyed, none of the respondents asked could name all of the 12 symbols correctly,
    and in fact, most of the respondents got over half of the descriptions wrong. There were also the people
    who knew “roughly” what the symbols meant, (for example, that something with an “X” was some sort of
    hazard, but couldn’t name the exact meaning).</p>
  <p>More interestingly, 90% of those people questioned recognised the recycle symbol but only 40% recognised
    the shelf life. As this is a common symbol on items such as make-up and cosmetics, it is worrying that
    over half of people would not be aware that they need to dispose of the items after this time. With over <a href="https://premiumbeautynews.com/en/Lipsticks-a-safe-bet,675" target="_blank">800-900 million</a> lipsticks sold every year worldwide, that could equate to quite a number!</p>
  <p>So if people aren’t always aware of the impact an icon has on their product storage, life or well-being,
    do some of the icons need to be on there at all? Or is it a consumer’s obligation to do their research
    and make themselves familiar with the symbols?</p>

                The Eco-Label is an icon of a daisy, and is a voluntary certification awarded by
                the European Union to products and services that have a reduced environmental
                impact throughout their life cycle, from the extraction of raw material through
                to production, use and disposal. Launched in 1992 to try and introduce a
                European mark that consumers could trust, the Eco-label can now be found on over
                17,000 products.</p>

                This symbol shows the product life of your item once it has been opened. The
                number in the middle of the “pot” shows the number of months that the product is
                good for before it should be thrown away.</p>

                The flammable symbol shows that the product has hazardous properties and is
                flammable. This means that you must be aware of factors such as proper storage,
                removal of any sources of ignition or other factors necessary to prevent a fire. </p>

                The CE mark is mandatory for certain items sold within the European Economic
                area, introduced in 1993. The CE mark is perhaps one of the most recognised
                marks and is used even by companies that are not based in the European Economic
                area but simply export there. The mark “ensures the free movement of products
                that conform to the legislation – eg safety, health and environmental protection
                – within the European market”. It covers a vast array of products. The full
                details of its application are detailed here: <a

                Any item between between 5 grams or millilitres and 10 kilograms or litres can

                Perhaps one of the more widely used packaging icons, the recycle symbol is a

                This symbol is commonly found on cargo packages, and encourages the handler to
                keep the package dry. In fact, this symbol was the most confusing of all for our
                survey group. Half of the people we asked actually thought that the symbol meant
                the opposite – i.e. that the package could indeed be water resistant.</p>

                recycled in accordance with the WEEE directive. See here for more details on
