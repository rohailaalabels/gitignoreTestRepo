                                the promise, which in the case of AA Labels are as follows: </p>
                            <h5 class="cBlue">1.1 CORE VALUES</h5>
                            <p><strong>Excellence, integrity, honesty, respect, reliability & trust </strong></p>
                            <p>As our customer, you are important to us. Our aim is to provide you with label solutions,
                                at fair prices and a responsive, friendly and helpful service. </p>
                            <p> Change is a continual part of good business practice to ensure that the latest
                                developments in technology and customer service are used to provide improvements to the
                                services available and the way you are treated as a customer. We promise to treat you
                                fairly in everything that we do and we will not forget that you have chosen to use AA
                                Labels and will work hard for you because we want you to experience the very best
                                service and remain a customer. </p>
                            <p> We respect our customer's decisions and requirements for labels and will always behave
                                with integrity regarding the information provided and consistently recommend and provide
                                the best solutions available. We continually work to improve the quality of the customer
                                experience in all aspects associated with the company's products and services and

                                with the highest standards of customer service time after time. </p>
                            <h5 class="cBlue"> 1.2 Motto</h5>
                            <p> We will produce, despatch and deliver customers orders: <strong>right first time, on
                                    time, every time</strong>
                            <h5 class="cBlue"> 1.3 Customer promise</h5>
                            The simpler the statement the easier it is to remember and apply to our everyday work,
                            therefore at AA Labels our promise is: <strong>"customer service is our top priority and we
                                thank you for being a customer"</strong>
                            </p>

                            <h5 class="cBlue">2.1 what counts as a complaint? </h5>
                            <p>A complaint is any contact from, or on behalf of a customer or potential customer who is
                                not satisfied with any part of our service. </p>
                            <h5 class="cBlue">2.2 resolving your complaint </h5>
                            <p>Our customer service team are trained to put things right for you straight away. If they
                                cannot do so they will connect you with a manager to discuss the matter. </p>
                            <p>The resolution of a complaint might include actions to put the mistake right, and
                                apology, an explanation or compensation in the form of a replacement order. </p>
                            <p>We aim to resolve nine out of ten complaints within two working days and we expect to be
                                able to resolve most other complaints within a week, but we will inform you if it might
                                take longer. </p>
                            <h5 class="cBlue">2.3 reviewing your complaint </h5>
                            <p>If you are not satisfied that we have corrected the mistake or you are not happy with how
                                we have dealt with the issue, we will carry out an internal review. We will look into
                                how we have handled your complaint and the resolution offered. We will let you know the
                                outcome of the review and the reasons for the decision. We will normally take less than
                                two working days to complete this review and if we agree to carry out other actions
                                following the review we will let you know how long this is likely to take also. </p>
