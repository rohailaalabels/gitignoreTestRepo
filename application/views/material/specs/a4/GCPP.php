  <h3 >Adhesive</h3>
  <p>This is a general purpose acrylic, pressure sensitive permanent adhesive for demanding labelling applications, including smooth and slightly rough or curved surfaces. With excellent initial tack, adhesion and wet-out performance, even on apolar surfaces such as high density Polyethylene (HDPE). Also improved temperature, water, solvent and chemical resistance.</p>

  <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
  <p>Applications are predominately in market segments where rigid containers are used (e.g. glass, polyester/PET). Due to the fairly rigid nature of the film, care should be taken with application and use on non-uniform surfaces and/or where a very high level of flexibility or squeezability is required (e.g. soap and shower gel containers). A particularly good choice for primary brand and product labels on rigid containers where it is important for the content to be visible and not partially obscured by a label. Also secondary promotional labels, informational labels, external labels/signage and safety labels/signage etc.</p>
  <p>With the British standard (BS) compliance for the marine performance test this material is widely used for haz-chem labels on drums and containers.</p>
  <h3>Conversion &amp; printing</h3>
  <p>This product is specifically designed for hot fuse sheet-fed and continuous (colour) laser printing. Providing optimal flatness during conversion, storage and laser printing processing. Some slight curl may be seen on exiting the printer but this will flatten quickly.</p>
  <h3>Approvals</h3>
  <p>The face-stock complies with EN 71-3 for Toy Safety, Electric & Electronic Equipment RoHS and the Packaging & Packaging Waste Directive 94/62/CE.
    The adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislations, FDA 175.105 and the German recommendations XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Riskobewertung) the German Federal Institute for risk assessment. The adhesive can be used in direct contact with dry and moist, non-fatty foodstuffs ISEGA - Adhesives. </p>
  <p>This product complies with the materials section of BS5609 Part 2 (Marine Performance Test). Customers should independently determine the compliance or otherwise of the ink and print process involved in the production of labels to the British standard.</p>
  <p>While the release liner complies with the German regulation on Contact with foodstuff BfR XXXVI for Face-stock & Liners (Paper), the Packaging & Packaging Waste Directive 94/62/CE, EN 71-3 for Toy Safety and Electric & Electronic Equipment RoHS.</p>
  <h3 >Shelf Life</h3>
  <p>Two years from the date of manufacture, under storage conditions as defined by FINAT <small>(Federation Internationale des Fabricants et Transformateurs d&acute; Adhesifs et Thermocllants sur papiers et autres supports)</small> 20° - 25° C and 40 – 50% RH.</p>
