  <p>We recently had an opportunity to work on the production of a large clear printed label for one of our
    plain label customers. IDO Beauty Ltd in Bolton had purchased a variety of blank roll labels for the
    printing of their product labels, but asked AA Labels to quote for the printing of a gloss clear
    Polypropylene printed label, including white, for their EuPro product range of Acrylic Liquid
    Monomer.</p>

      <h2 class="headingPost">Label Designer</h2>
      <p>The label design featured some fine line white printing required, which using the Epson Sure
        Press advanced inkjet technology allowed the accuracy required and the result was a very
        satisfied customer.</p>
      <p>Digital print technology combined with our online services reduces the complexity and stages
        required in ordering printed labels and if our customers require assistance with design and
        material choices for their labels, our customer care team is on hand to help.</p>

    <p>The client was very pleased with the enhanced finish quality of the labels produced, by comparison
      with their current labels. Proof if it were needed that continuous investment in digital print
      technology provides tangible benefits in product appearance and quality for the customer.</p>
