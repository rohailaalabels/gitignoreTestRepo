        <h4 class="cBlue">Making up a batch of jam?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">Homemade jam is not only delicious but it is also relatively easy to make. At AA Labels, we provide the perfect finishing touch to your jam jars in the form of a variety of sticky labels, enabling you to personalise your jams , chutneys, pickles and preserves. </p>
        <p class="text-justify"> Jam-making in Europe can be traced back to the 16th century, after the arrival of the Spanish in the West Indies, who had been preserving fruits for generations. In Tudor times, quince and medlar were popular. </p>
        <p class="text-justify"> Anything that is lovingly homemade deserves a pretty jar and personalised labels for preserves and chutneys will do just the trick. We have thousands of label combinations including a huge range of materials and different shapes, label sizes and colours, suitable for you to print on, with your inkjet printer, laser printer or photocopier. Just choose a label sheet and we'll manufacture it for you in our Cambridge factory. </p>
        <p class="text-justify"> If you need help printing and designing your label, we can do it for you - visit our <a href="<?=base_url()?>printed-labels/">label printing</a> page. </p>

        <h4 class="cBlue">Be the star of the show at fetes and competitions</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">Stand out from the crowd by combining a well-designed jam jar label with doilies, rounds of material or coloured paper. Jazz up your jam jars with coloured rubber bands, ribbon, bows, and even flowers! An idea that works particularly well for a competition is choosing a round self-adhesive label to stick on your jar lid. This is great if you are displaying your jams on a table, and want people to see your flavour, name and/or brand!</p>

        <h4 class="cBlue">Promote your jam making business</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">The tradition of making and selling jam at farmers' markets and local fetes is still going strong. Small businesses want their jams, chutneys and preserves to appeal to the eye as well as the mouth, and so personalised labels in your company colours work well. As well as the core colours, we have pastels, fluorescents, and luxury shades like cream and terracotta. Instead, you might want to go for a red label for strawberry jam, or orange for apricot butter, for example, and match your label to your jar's contents. </p>
        <p class="text-justify"> For a vintage look, another idea is to attach each label to a piece of card, and hang them with a piece of decorative string around your jar instead of sticking them to the actual container.</p>

        <h4 class="cBlue">Jam jar labels for wedding favours</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">What better than to give each guest a homemade jar of jam or chutney, as a very personal and sincere gift for attending your wedding. When catering for so many guests, there isn't always time to hand-write each label and so printed labels are a much easier option. A white high gloss label would be a perfect match for the bride and groom, or for that super special occasion you might choose matt gold or matt silver. Or, go with a hard-wearing <a href="https://www.aalabels.com/polyester-labels/">gloss clear polyester</a> label and cover each jar with some gingham fabric for some real old-English charm. Each jar and its label will be made to last so that memories live on for years to come!</p>
