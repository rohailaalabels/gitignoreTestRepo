    <p>It is often true in sales and marketing that it is easier to retain existing customers than attract new
      ones. Yet in most business plans I’ve come across, the biggest focus is set on gaining new clients!</p>
    <p>When you look at the cost associated with finding and generating new business sales, compared with the
      costs of customer retention, there are some simple and cost effective ways of increasing your existing
      customer loyalty (whilst at the same time improving your marketing) by using labels on your product or
      packaging. Labels can be an important communication tool.</p>
    <p>Here are 5 of the best ways we’ve found to increase loyalty with labels:</p>
    <p><span class="tt-dropcap-orange"><span class="tt-dropcap-round">1</span></span></p>
    <p><strong>Go back to your roots – Share your product or company story.</strong><br>
      In recent years, this has become extremely popular on food packaging, but can also extend to almost any
      industry type. If you are providing a product or service, use a label to add your name, brand or origin
      to your product, or even your unique sales benefit – i.e. ‘handpicked by Jim’. It could be the fact your
      product is ‘100% recyclable’, ‘comes all the way from Maggie’s farm’, or gives ‘10% of all profits back
      to a chosen charity’. Sharing your positive business attributes can make people form a connection with
      your brand that keeps you in the forefront of their minds.</p>
    <p><span class="tt-dropcap-orange"><span class="tt-dropcap-round">2</span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Excel
      at customer service<br>
      </strong>This may seem like an obvious answer, but labels can go a long way in helping to provide good
      customer service, especially when keeping customers abreast of company developments. Add a small label
      to your order acknowledgements or invoices with details of new product launches (cross selling), or add
      small news bulletins which can be changed when needed. Get people actually looking out for your
      correspondence!</p>
    <p><span class="tt-dropcap-orange"><span class="tt-dropcap-round">3</span></span>&nbsp;<strong>Give a
      personalised thank you</strong><br>
      It can be challenging for smaller businesses to find an edge over large corporate organisations, but a
      special thank you with a personalised gift label will set you apart from the competition.</p>
    <p><span class="tt-dropcap-orange"><span class="tt-dropcap-round">4</span></span>&nbsp;<strong>Offer private
      labelling &amp; branding<br>
      </strong>By private labelling, I do not mean licencing your product to another company to sell under its
      name. This does not have to be a complicated or expensive task. I am talking about using labelling to
      offer a service to your customer which will help them market in an easy way! Add a bespoke sticker to
      your product with your client’s logo, perhaps with their telephone number, and let them reap the
      benefits of repeat sales of your product.</p>
    <p><span class="tt-dropcap-orange"><span class="tt-dropcap-round">5</span></span>&nbsp;<strong>Make it easy
      for people to find you</strong><br>
      QR codes can be great on labels as a marketing tool, directing people back to your website, encouraging
      repeat orders and also marketing your business as a forward thinking, technologically advanced leader.
      Websites such as <a href="http://www.createqrcode.co.uk/"
                                    target="_blank">http://www.createqrcode.co.uk/</a> can create your codes for free.
      For an added cost, barcode labels can be a great way of streamlining your product lines internally and
      externally, saving you (and your clients) time and money.</p><a href="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>label-hygiene-bin.png"><img
                  class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-122 pull-right" alt="label used on a hygiene bin"
                  src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>label-hygiene-bin-240x300.png" width="240"
                  height="300"></a>
    <p>Just recently, a client approached me and said they were finding it hard to sell a product as whenever
      they introduced it to an end user they couldn’t figure out how to open the unit. So was this a simple
      oversight? Or a huge design error? Well either way – the one thing that was apparent was that if they
      wanted to sell the product then it needed a product modification. The easiest and cheapest way to change
      it was by adding a label.</p>
    <p>Labels not only allow you to improve delivery of your product whilst increasing customer loyalty, but
      also allow you to try ideas out that perhaps you wouldn’t usually. By perhaps opting for a removable
      label for your product or business, if you change your mind or business strategy, you can change your
      label. Be more daring!</p>
    <p>This label transformed a standard feminine hygiene bin into a great marketing tool for a great cause,
      whilst increasing customer loyalty and support for the charity from its partners.</p>
