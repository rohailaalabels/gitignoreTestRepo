  <p>It’s Christmas! Well almost. It’s certainly time to get the Christmas card list out and start scribbling
    your messages to friends and loved ones.</p>
  <p>Nowadays with almost everyone using digital devices to communicate it is a real pleasure to receive
    something personal in the post. For me, it doesn’t get better than a Christmas card!</p>
  <p>So why not make your cards even more special by ramping up the Christmas theme on the outside of the
    envelope by using Christmas address labels? Well, you may not have done it because it takes too long to
    create your own from scratch. Now you don’t have to because we’ve designed them for you and created
    editable and printable templates featuring our ‘Winter Wishes’ design.</p>
  <p><strong>The templates were initially created to be used as address labels and envelope seals but they
    could also be used as present labels, stickers for gift tags and general Christmas
    stickers.</strong></p>
  <p>Of course the address label template could also be used for return address labels if you’ve moved and
    want to let people know you’re at a new address. For this purpose I’ve created an ‘Autofill’ template
    below so that you only have to enter your address twice (one in the left column, once in the middle
    column) and it is repeated across all the labels – no copy and paste! You can then print as many sheets
    of labels as you like and stick them on your cards or the back of the envelope.</p>
  <p>Once you’ve edited the templates and printed the labels you’ve made, stick them on your envelopes (or
    presents, gift tags, parcels etc) to create something like this:</p>

  <p><strong id="designer">This is what our honey label designer has to say:</strong></p>
  <p>Winter Wishes Address Label Range</p>
  <p>Christmas is a time of giving. It is also a time when people send their love and thoughts to others
    through cards and letters. Whether it is their best friend in the whole wide world or a long lost friend
    they have not seen for years, Christmas is a time of telling people that you are dear to them.</p>
  <p>I love receiving mail from family and friends. I still get excited when I see a letter by my front door
    with my name on it (Unless it is a bill). It is this great feeling that was my main source of
    inspiration for the address labels. I really wanted to design lovely stickers that would make someone
    smile and get excited before they even opened up the envelope for the surprise that’s inside.</p>
  <p>When designing this range of address labels and stickers, 1950s illustrations and colours were my
    inspiration. I wanted them to have a retro feel but with a modern twist. Even though I used the
    traditional red and green Christmas colours, I feel the shades I used help to give the design that 50s
    vibe I was going for. But the font I chose and the minimalistic illustrations help to keep it
    modern.</p>
  <p>One of my favourite parts of Christmas is decorating the tree and wrapping up the presents to go under
    it. So I thought what better design to do other than a tree and some baubles. I think these stickers
    could make great labels for presents too! I could imagine a brown paper package with one of these bright
    labels stuck on it and some matching red ribbon.</p>
  <p>I hope your friends and family will get as much joy receiving a card or gift that is adorned with these
    labels as I did designing them.</p>

  <h2 id="address">The Christmas address &amp; present label templates</h2>
  <p>Here are the four Christmas label designs which are included in the template (not actual size). Here they
    have addresses on them but don’t be limited to using them just for address labels. You can edit the text
    to whatever you like. For example, using these as stickers on presents you might want edit the text on a
    label to say ‘Merry Christmas Fred, Love Freda x’ and do that for all the people you’re giving presents
    to. You can make a sheet of labels up like this, print them out and stick them on the appropriate
    presents so you know whose is whose.</p>

  <h2 id="howto">How to use the Christmas label templates</h2>
  <p>The above templates are designed to work with the following label sizes (follow the links to the product
    page to buy):</p>
  <p><a href="http://localhost/a4-sheets/rectangle/t35/">For the rectangular address labels AAS021 63.5mm x
    38.1mm</a> This is also equivalent to Avery L7160 and J8160 – so if you already have these, they
    should work.</p>
  <p><a href="http://localhost/a4-sheets/circular/t83/">For the round Christmas stickers AAC035 35mm
    diameter</a></p>
  <p>You can choose matt white paper or even gloss white to create a shiny effect.</p>
  <p>To use the templates you’ll need Adobe Reader (a free software – if you read PDFs you’re likely to have
    it). Other PDF readers <em>may</em> work but if you want to edit the PDF and get the same printing
    results we do then it’s best to use Adobe Reader. Detailed guidelines on how to edit and print all our
    editable templates are <a title="How To Print and Edit Our Free Label Templates"
                                          href="https://localhost/blog/label-templates/print-edit-free-label-templates/">here</a>. </p>
  <p>The differences from the instructions given on that page are:</p>
  <p>1. With the Autofill Christmas Address Labels template you’ll need to enter the address you want repeated
    across the labels twice; once in the first column and once in the second. This is because the colour of
    the text is different.</p>
  <p>2. If you’d like to edit the font or colour, you need to delete the default content of the label first
    and then enter the new message/address <strong>before</strong> following the guidelines given in the
    link above.</p>
  <p>If you have a design or want to create a completely <a href="http://localhost/customlabels.php?cat_id=1">custom
    label</a>, you can find blank <a title="Address Labels"
                                                     href="http://localhost/a4-sheets/rectangle/">address labels</a> here</p>
