						  <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>Applications are predominately in market segments where rigid containers are used (e.g. glass, polyester/PET). Due to the fairly rigid nature of the film, care should be taken with application and use on non-uniform surfaces and/or where a very high level of flexibility or squeezability is required (e.g. soap and shower gel containers). A good choice for primary brand and product labels on rigid containers, secondary promotional labels, asset labels, informational labels, external labels/signage and safety labels/signage etc.</p>
                         
                          <h3>Conversion &amp; Printing</h3>
                          <p>The modified acrylic based top-coating can be printed by most conventional printing techniques, including flexo; screen; offset-litho; letterpress, silkscreen; gravure and hot or cold foiling processes. UV, water-based and solvent-based inks can be used. The topcoat is designed for optimum ink adhesion. On-press corona treatment is not advised. The face material is suitable for Thermal Transfer printing with specific ribbons (exact inks, foils and ribbons should be specified by your ink/foil/ribbon supplier). The material has excellent register properties, especially when a high number of colour are used.</p> 
                          
                          
                  
                          <h3>Approvals</h3>
                          <p>The adhesive complies with the European food directives and legislation FDA 21; CFR 175, 105 and the German recommendations XIV as published by BfR (Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung) the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Both of which state that the adhesive can be used in direct contact with dry, moist and non-fatty foodstuffs, however according to the FDA regulations the adhesive must be separated from the foodstuffs by a functional barrier.</p>
