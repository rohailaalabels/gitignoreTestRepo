  <p>Got honey? Need to create a label for your jars? The work has been done here for you. Simply download the
    desired templates, edit and print (sheets of labels for the templates are available too).</p>
  <p><strong>This free printable label template set is designed for those who sell honey.</strong> It follows
    on from our <a title="Honey Jar Label Template: “Ode to The Honey Bee”"
                               href="https://localhost/blog/print-templates/honey-jar-label-template-ode-honey-bee/">previous
    honey label template</a> which had less space for text and, even though editable, it was more suited
    to gifting honey than for selling it. For that reason close attention has been paid to UK honey
    labelling regulations for this template set (although you’ll need to check with your local trading
    standards if you want to be sure everything’s covered).</p>
  <p>Editable parts include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Heading (Should contain the word ‘Honey’)</li>
    <li>Weight</li>
    <li>Name and Address</li>
    <li>Country of Origin (e.g. ‘Produce of England’).</li>
    <li>Best Before Date</li>
    <li>Lot number</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As each section is fully editable, you don’t have to use them as described although they may be required
    if you’re selling honey.</p>
  <p>Using templates like this enables you to fully personalise your jars quickly and easily. The benefit is
    that you can print as many or as few as you need for your batch and you can change the text whenever
    necessary, when you need to change the batch number for example.</p>
  <p><strong>This label template set includes a jar label, a lid label and a tamper seal (all
    editable)</strong>. All templates are in colour as well as black and white, in case you don’t have a
    colour printer or you want to print on labels of a particular colour – yellow for example.</p>
  <p>Features of the PDF templates:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can edit all the text (including font style, font size and colour).</li>
    <li>You can delete any of the text if it’s not required for your particular use.</li>
    <li><strong>Autofill</strong> template feature: When you make a change any of the text it will change on
      the other labels in the template. This saves time if you’re printing several labels with the same
      text. </li>
  </ul>

    something like this:</p>

  <p><strong id="designer">This is what our honey label designer has to say:</strong></p>
  <p>Two tones… some of the best things around are made up of just two tones. The keys on a piano, rhubarb and
    custard sweets, chocolate chip cookies, a Sheffield Wednesday shirt (ok – that’s just me). And of
    course, the stripes on a honeybee.</p>
  <p>Yellow and black, they wear it well. They know how to rock that look better than anyone!</p>
  <p>That’s the basis of this design. Shocks of bright yellow and charcoal black to decorate your next batch
    of tasty honey and show off its name and details.</p>
  <p>The front of the jar focuses in on a central hexagon, symbolising the honeycomb structure synonymous with
    this tasty preserve. We know instantly what is within once we see this shape.</p>
  <p>Inside this, we see a white hive – almost like we’re looking through a window into a garden and seeing
    this in the middle distance. Hive by name, hive of activity by nature… this is the factory where the
    golden treasure is produced by this most diligent of workforce.</p>
  <p>Speaking of workforce – this hexagon leads down into a little graphic below, representing the bee
    herself, with her stripy uniform and sting mounted tail. A little reminder of who we owe thanks to for
    this tasty treat, whilst we crunch down on another slice of generously covered toast or golden sheened
    crumpet.</p>
  <p>The editable title and details use solid yet friendly fonts, change these to put your own stamp down and
    christen the bounty within. The bee did the work, but the world needs to know that you did your bit
    too!</p>
  <p>Enjoy the labels – enjoy the honey more!</p>

  <h2 id="howto">How to use the honey jar label templates</h2>
  <p>We’ve tried to make it as simple as download, edit and print!</p>
  <p>The above templates are designed to work with the following label sizes (follow the links to the product
    page to buy):<br>
    <a href="http://localhost/a4-sheets/rectangle/t18/">For the rectangular jar labels AAE010 75mm x
    50mm</a><br>
    <a href="http://localhost/a4-sheets/circular/t75/">For the circular lid labels AAC024 45mm
    diameter</a><br>
    <a href="http://localhost/a4-sheets/rectangle/t250/">For the narrow rectangular tamper seals AAL026
    100mm x 10mm</a></p>
  <p>To use the templates you’ll need Adobe Reader (a free software – if you read PDFs you’re likely to have
    it). Other PDF readers <em>may</em> work but if you want to edit the PDF and get the same printing
    results we do then it’s best to use Adobe Reader. Detailed guidelines on how to edit and print all our
    editable templates are <a title="How To Print and Edit Our Free Label Templates"
                                          href="https://localhost/blog/label-templates/print-edit-free-label-templates/">here</a> </p>
  <p>If you have a design or want to create a completely <a href="http://localhost/customlabels.php?cat_id=1">custom
    label</a>, you can find blank <a title="Honey Jar Labels" href="http://localhost/honey-jar-labels/"
