    <p>It is a known fact that different colours can stir certain emotions in us. For example, red has been
      found to muster feelings of excitement and arousal whereas sky-blue can make us feel calm and serene.
      You wouldn’t see many baby products brands or packaging in fire-engine red.</p>

    <p>As well as physiological properties, colours and combinations of colours can also be associated with
      symbolism. Especially when in the context of product packaging, certain colour combinations can suggest
      what the product is for or what the brand represents. You wouldn’t find many men’s aftershave brands in
      pastel pink!</p>

    <p>Launching with a brand or packaging that is attractive, eye-catching and relevant is key to your success
      and colour plays a massive part in this formula.</p>

    <p>There are steps you can take to choose the right palette for your new brand.</p>
    <h2>1. Create a short list of the emotions/words associated with your brand/products</h2>
    <p>Some can be general emotions or descriptive words which would also describe your competitors’ product.
      For example, if you had an organic skincare range some of these words might be ‘Earthy’, ‘Gentle’,
      ‘Healthy’, ‘Natural’. One or two of the words however might be your specific to your point of
      difference. For example if the point of difference for your new organic skincare range is ‘more
      contemporary and trendy than your average organic skincare range’, the words ‘contemporary’ and ‘chic’
      might make it in to your list also.</p>
    <h2>2. Choose the colours that best suit these words</h2>
    <p>Use this Colour ‘Wheel of Emotions’ as a guide to choose the colours that pair nicely with your list of
      words.</p>
    <p><a href="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>colour-wheel-emotions.jpg"><img

    <p>Here is our organic skincare example:<br>
      Earthy – Browns<br>
      Gentle – Light Blues, warm yellows<br>
      Healthy – Greens<br>
      Natural – Greens and Browns<br>
      Contemporary/Chic – Black, White</p>
    <h2>3. Check that these colours have been accepted to represent your product category by analysing
      competitor products.</h2>
    <p>To make sure you aren’t confusing the customer as to what the product is for, do some competitor
      research. You don’t want your brand and packaging to look the same as your competitors otherwise you
      won’t stand out or be any different, however if your choice of colour palette is too obscure for that
      category people will not be able to tell what your product is for at first glance.</p>
    <p>If we were to use the organic skincare range as an example, we might discover that our above list of
      colours are widely accepted as communicating the correct message, except if we were to use an excessive
      amount of black and white, it may not be obvious enough that the products are indeed organic and
      natural.</p>
    <h2>4. Come up with a nice combination of complimentary colours that are original and look right with your
      logo/packaging design.</h2>
    <p>Now that you have a broad idea of colour groups, you need to get more specific with the shades of colour
      you choose. Choosing a selection of colours that compliment each other is not easy, however there are
      plenty of online tools that could assist or inspire you. Below are three good ones that are simple to
      use.</p>

    <p>Below is an example of an existing organic skincare range with a complimentary colour palette that could
      be described as earthy, gentle, healthy, natural and contemporary. Their packaging and palette is
      original but not misleading as to its purpose.</p>
