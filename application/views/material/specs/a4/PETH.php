      <h3 >Adhesive</h3>
      <p>A specialist purpose permanent, acrylic based, pressure sensitive, waterborne adhesive (RP Cryo). This adhesive is designed to perform in cryopreservation storage conditions down to -196°C. The adhesive is recommended for identification labelling on Polypropylene (PP) cryogenic vials, tubes and storage boxes (cardboard and PP).</p>
      <p>In addition the adhesive also provides good performance in high temperature applications, withstanding temperatures of up to 121°C for intermittent periods of time.</p>

      <p>Label materials based on RP Cryo retain their adhesion on PP vials, tubes and storage boxes over long periods of time, in both vapour and liquid phase in liquid Nitrogen storage tanks. This adhesive withstands multiple freeze-thaw cycles (reconstitution can be done, for example in ice water, or a warm water bath; samples can later be returned to the liquid Nitrogen storage tank). Stiffness of the face material, die-cutting direction, storage conditions and the container diameter can influence label edge lifting. </p>
      <p>The face-stock material (PE Laser White) and adhesive laminate achieves a score < 2 (moderate off-flavour) in a Sensory Analysis for Indirect Transition of Taste according to EN1230-2 (Robinson Test).</p>

      <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
      <p>Ideal for the labelling of cryogenically stored biological information and samples in various formats. Overprinting of variable data and updating of information via conventional hand written means. Also used for labelling items where heat is generated, such as PCB’s, automotive engine parts and heating systems etc. Along with chemical drum and logistics applications. Due to the exceptional thickness and stability large label sizes can be used.</p>
      <h3 >Conversion & Printing</h3>
      <p>The labels can be overprinted by colour digital offset, hot and cold laser, dot matrix, laser and thermal transfer printers.</p>
      <p>Due to the surface properties of the face-stock the Polyethylene film is pre-printable by screen, offset, flexography, letterpress, electro-photography, electro-graph, digital offset and dot matrix. Inks for filmic substrates are recommended. Also thermal transfer with selected ribbons.</p>
      <h3>Approvals</h3>
      <p>The ISEGA research centre has approved the adhesive RP Cryo according to European requirements for direct contact with dry and moist, non-fatty foodstuffs, as well as fatty foodstuffs with a correction factor of at least 2, or for which the foodstuff stimulant D1 applies according to Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011. In addition labels coated with this adhesive may be used to label food packaging materials. According to FDA regulations RP Cryo may come into direct contact with dry foodstuffs, or it must be separated from foodstuffs by a functional barrier. RP Cryo is approved from the patient safety point of view (migration tested) for labelling blood bags ISEGA has EN ISO 17025 accreditation for analytics and EN45011fro certification.</p>
      <p>The raw materials conform to EU 10/2011 and this adhesive is in compliance with the demands of the Code of Federal Regulations Food and Drugs (FDA) 21 CFR Ch 1 (01.04.2013 edition) 175.105</p>
