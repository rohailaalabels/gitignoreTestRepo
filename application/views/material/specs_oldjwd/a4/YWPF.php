                          <p>The machine finished surface of this ECF (Elemental Chlorine Free) flood coated yellow paper provides an excellent quality of imprint with all traditional printing methods. The material is equally suitable for thermal transfer printing and is therefore universally applicable.</p>
                          <p>The pulp for this paper comes from PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification). This guarantees improvements in sustainable forest management against agreed ecological, social and economic criteria.</p>
