        <div>
            <h4>Legal Relationship </h4>
            <p class="text-justify">In these terms reference to the "Order" is a reference to your order for the goods,
                whether made verbally or in writing by telephone, fax, post, email, online or other means. "Writing"
                includes email and online transmission and other comparable means of communication.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">All Orders constitute an offer by you to enter into a binding contract, which we are
                free to accept or decline at our absolute discretion. No legal contract will exist between us in
                relation to the goods set out in your Order unless and until the Order is accepted by us and will then
                be subject to these terms.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Confirmation of our acceptance of your Order, and at which point a legally binding
                contract will come into existence between us, will occur by our issuing you with a written acceptance
                (which may be by electronic email) or by notifying you that the goods set out in the Order are ready for
                delivery to you. The payment by you and our acceptance of any deposit does not itself constitute an
                acceptance of your Order and the deposit will be refunded in full if we do not accept your Order.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Please check these terms and the information set out in your Order (and any
                documents or drawings that you have supplied that are to form part of the Order) carefully before
                submitting your Order to ensure that they are complete and accurate as we cannot be liable for any
                inaccuracies or omissions in your Order. Please check in particular that you have ensured that the items
                Ordered are compatible with your equipment.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">If you think that there is a mistake or omission, please notify us immediately, but
                if we have already accepted your Order you will be bound by the terms of that Order unless we are able
                to agree otherwise. We will endeavour, but are not obliged, to agree to any change requested but no
                amendment or cancellation of an Order will be effective unless agreed by us in writing or in accordance
                with your cancellation rights below. </p>

            <h4> Consumer cancellation rights </h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Please note that nothing in these terms will apply to exclude or limit your rights,
                where they apply, under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges)
                Regulations 2013 which set out certain rights, including a right to cancel certain Orders within 14
                days. </p>
            <p><strong>These Regulations, and this section of our terms, only apply where you are purchasing as a
                    consumer, and not where you are purchasing in connection with any business, trade or
                    profession.</strong></p>
            <p>To exercise your right to cancel, you must notify us of this within 14 days after the day on which you
                receive the goods or the last instalment of them (if sent by multiple deliveries).</p>
            <p class="text-justify">You can cancel by email: <a href="mailto:customercare@aalabels.com">customercare@aalabels.com</a>
                or telephone 01733 588390, or by post to 23 Wainman Road, Woodston, Peterborough, PE2 7BU, United
                Kingdom. You may use the model cancellation form here, but it is not obligatory. Please ensure that any
                notice clearly confirms that you are exercising this right and confirms your name, address, the details
                of the order (such as the order number and date of order) and contact details for you.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">If you do exercise this right, you need to return the goods to us at your cost
                within 14 days of the date of the cancellation notice. We will then reimburse to you (by the same method
                used to pay for the goods) the price of the goods to which cancellation notice relates. This includes
                any standard delivery charges that we made when sending the goods to you in the first place, but not the
                costs of any more expensive method of delivery that you may have asked for.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Until the goods are returned to us you must keep possession of them and take
                reasonable care of them. Please note that we can deduct from any reimbursement the loss in value of any
                goods if you do not return them within the 14 day return period or if they have been lost or damaged as
                a result of you not taking reasonable care of them. </p>
            <p class="text-justify"><strong>Your right to return goods does not apply to orders for goods made or
                    modified to your specification or which you or anyone else authorised by you has used. Please note
                    that our supply of labels to your order, such as your choice of shape, sizing, pattern or materials,
                    is a supply of goods to your specification as these items are made specifically on your request and
                    are not supplied from existing stock. Accordingly you do not have the right to cancel under the
                    Regulations. </strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify">If your order includes an order for any services from us, other than provision of
                goods to your specification, we will require your separate authority to proceed within the 14 day
                cancellation period and this will affect your cancellation rights. If we proceed within your authority
                within the 14 day period but you then cancel under the Regulations, you will still be required to pay us
                a proportionate amount of our charges for the services provided before you cancel, or the full amount if
                the services have been fully performed.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">These provisions do not limit your rights in respect of goods or services that were
                damaged or defective or of unsatisfactory quality when supplied by us, in which case please notify us of
                the damage or defect or unsatisfactory service and we will arrange collection of the affected goods and
                inspection of the works at our expense. </p>

            <h4 class="cBlue">Quality </h4>
            <p class="text-justify"> We will provide goods that are at their time of delivery by us of satisfactory
                quality, in conformity with the accepted Order and fit for any purpose we say the goods are fit for. We
                will carry out any agreed services with reasonable care and skill in accordance with our statutory
                duties to you. </p>
            <p class="text-justify"> Our duties and warranties to you do not apply to any damage or defect in goods
                arising from fair wear and tear, wilful damage, accident, negligence by you or any third party, if you
                use the goods in a way that we do not recommend, if you have ordered the wrong items, if you fail to
                follow our reasonable instructions, or any alteration or repair you carry out without our prior written
                approval. </p>

            <h4 class="cBlue">Specifications</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Unless otherwise agreed by us, any samples, drawings, descriptions or advertising we
                issue, and any descriptions or illustrations contained in our catalogues or brochures, are issued or
                published solely to provide you with an approximate idea of the goods and services they describe. We
                will not be liable for any innocent minor variations that do not affect the quality and usability of the
                goods. </p>
            <p class="text-justify"> This can happen for example as a result of publishing variations or different
                screen resolutions and the actual shade and tone and other colour features of the goods may appear
                differently on separate monitors and other display devices and may vary slightly from batch to batch in
                the manufacturing process. Samples are available, though actual colour representation of the final
                product may still vary from batch to batch and any sample provided may not be from the batch
                subsequently supplied as part of your order. </p>
            <p class="text-justify"> Please note that in the event that a generic or brand compatible item ordered by
                you is not available at the time of despatch, we reserve the right to substitute an ordered item with
                another suitable generic or brand compatible item of equal or higher value. If you are not satisfied
                with the substitution you may cancel the order as set out above and we will meet the cost of returning
                the substitute goods. We will not substitute original brand products without your prior agreement.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"> These terms do not affect your statutory right to cancel or any rights that you may
                have to make a claim against us or the manufacturer for any breach of statutory duty, breach of
                contract, or negligence. </p>

            <h4>Delivery of goods to you </h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Unless we have agreed special delivery arrangements with you, Orders are usually
                despatched for standard delivery within 3 to 5 working days of confirmation of your Order. However,
                occasionally delivery may be affected by factors beyond our control and so cannot be guaranteed and time
                of delivery is not of the essence of the contract.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"> Delivery may be by a single delivery or by several instalments. Our failure to
                deliver any particular instalments will not entitle you to cancel the whole Order (other than under your
                consumer cancellation rights) but we will replace or refund the missing items. You will not be charged
                extra delivery costs if we deliver by instalments unless we have agreed this with you at the date of
                acceptance of the Order.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"> Full risk and responsibility for damage caused to or by the use handling or storage
                of the goods will pass to you on delivery of the goods to you (including from the moment of collection
                from our premises if we have agreed this as the delivery address). Delivery will, unless otherwise
                agreed by us, be to the premises stated in the Order.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"> If you refuse or fail to take delivery of goods in accordance with the Order or
                provide us with incorrect or inadequate delivery details, full risk and responsibility for the goods as
                above will pass to you at the time of our attempted delivery. We will also be entitled to charge you
                (and to deduct and retain from any payment by you) an amount representing our reasonable assessment of
                our expenses (including restocking costs and insurance) and lost profits in fulfilling your Order. Our
                restocking costs are usually 30% of the value of the Order (excluding VAT) but may be lower than this
                where we assess our reasonable costs to be less.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">Where we are supplying any goods for delivery outside of or export from the United
                Kingdom, it is your responsibility to ensure that all laws and regulations relating to the importation
                of the goods to the destination territory are complied with and all importation and other local duties
                and taxes are paid.</p>

            <p class="text-justify"><strong>The following provisions are separate to your consumer cancellation
                    rights.</strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify"> You are required to inspect all goods and notify us in writing of any shortage
                damage defect or other non-conformity with the Order within a reasonable time from delivery. In most
                cases, and unless otherwise agreed by us, we would expect this to be within 3 days of your receipt of
                the goods or, in the case of late or non-delivery, 3 days from the due date of delivery. If you fail to
                do so, or if you fail to return to us or allow us to collect the relevant goods, you will be deemed to
                have accepted the goods as having been delivered in accordance with the Order.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"> We will arrange collection of any perceived faulty or defective goods on a date
                agreed between us or ask you to return the goods to us at our cost (subject to recharge to you in the
                event that the goods are identified as not being faulty or defective).</p>
            <p class="text-justify"> Before returning any goods to us, please contact us to obtain a return merchandise
                authorisation (RMA) number or so that we may advise you to contact the manufacturer direct if your claim
                is covered by its warranty. Please ensure that goods are returned to us within 10 days of our issuing
                you with an RMA number. We may be unable to process goods received after this period or without a valid
                RMA number and the items may be returned to you.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"> In the event that any goods are confirmed as having been faulty or defective or
                missing at the time of delivery and we are liable to you in that regard, we will at our discretion offer
                you with a full or partial refund depending on the goods affected or repair or replace the affected
                goods. Upon doing so, we shall have no further liability to you (whether for breach of contract, breach
                of warranty or otherwise) including for any delay, loss of goodwill, loss of profit or other costs
                expenses or losses arising as a result.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"> We will own any goods that are returned to us as faulty and will be entitled at our
                discretion to return these to the manufacturer, recondition them, or otherwise deal or dispose of
                them.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"> In the event that on analysis it is identified that the goods were not faulty or
                defective and did comply with these terms when delivered, then we are entitled to charge you for those
                goods in accordance with these terms and also to charge you for the costs of collecting them and our
                usual price for any replacement goods supplied that we were not obliged to provide. </p>

        <div>
            <h4 class="cBlue">Price and Payment Terms </h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The price of the goods and services will be as set out in the Order as accepted by
                us or, if no price is stated in the Order or the quoted price has expired, the price will be as set out
                in our price list in force at the time we confirm your Order. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">If there is any difference or ambiguity between our relevant price list and any
                prices stated in the Order, the prices stated in the Order will apply once we have accepted the Order.
                Please note that, unless previously withdrawn by us or otherwise stated in the quotation, any quotation
                given by us will only be valid for 30 days from the date it is given. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">We may amend our published prices at any time, though this will not affect Orders
                already accepted by us. We will notify you before accepting your Order if there has been a variation in
                our prices after the date your Order was submitted. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Unless otherwise stated in the Order these prices exclude VAT for which you will be
                additionally liable at the rate applicable to the Order. You will additionally be liable for our costs
                of packing loading unloading carriage and insurance in respect of the Order. Where you are purchasing as
                a non-consumer, we may amend our carriage and insurance charges up to the date of delivery to reflect
                any actual increases in these costs to us between the date of acceptance of your Order and the delivery
                date. We may not increase our delivery charges for consumer Orders without your agreement. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the goods we sell may
                be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that where
                the correct price for the goods is less than our stated price we will charge the lower amount when
                dispatching the goods to you. If the correct price for the goods is higher than the price stated then we
                will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the goods or
                reject the Order and tell you. If the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have
                reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing then we do not have to provide the goods to you at the
                incorrect lower price. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Unless otherwise agreed by us, payment for all goods must be made in full (without
                deduction set-off counterclaim or other withholding, unless pursuant to a Court order) in cleared funds
                or by credit or debit card in advance of delivery. Time is of the essence for payment and we may refuse
                to fulfil your order if payment is not made when due. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">We may at our discretion offer credit terms which, where agreed by us, are usually
                30 days from the date of invoice or end of the calendar month. Credit terms are usually only available
                to existing customers with an order history from us. If you wish to apply for a credit facility, please
                contact us for details. You must ensure that you provide us with all information and documentation that
                we may reasonably require for considering any credit request and that all such information is true and
                accurate in all respects. We may withdraw any agreed credit at any time on not less than 14 days' notice
                to you, or immediately without notice in the event that you fail to make any payment in accordance with
                the agreed credit terms or if we believe that any of the information or documentation that you have
                provided to us as part of your credit application is incorrect misleading or fraudulent. Upon the
                withdrawal expiry or termination of any credit facility, the full balance of the account will be
                immediately due and payable. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">If you do not make any payment due to us in cleared funds by the due date for
                payment, we may charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of 2% a year above the base
                lending rate of HSBC Bank plc from time to time. Where you are dealing with us other than as a consumer,
                we reserve the right to charge interest under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998
                and related regulations. Interest will accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of
                actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You must pay us interest
                together with the overdue amount. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Without limiting any other remedies or rights that we may have, if you do not pay us
                on time, we may cancel or suspend the Order and any other outstanding Order until you have paid the
                outstanding amounts.</p>
