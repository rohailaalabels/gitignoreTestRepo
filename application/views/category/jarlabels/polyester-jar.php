 <h4 class="cBlue">Durability and functionality of polyester labels</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">When searching for the right label, you need to know that the material   you choose is suitable for the job in hand.  With our range of polyester   sticky labels you can rest assured you have chosen a robust and   resilient label. Choose   from a range of colours: orange, yellow, white, clear or silver (gloss   and matt finish available for clear and white labels).You can also   choose to have a peelable adhesive on matt white and clear polyester   labels.</p>
             <p class="text-justify">
              Polyester is a hard wearing material used in many   industrial and commercial applications because of its advantages over   other fabrics such as improved colour retention and durability.</p>
             <p class="text-justify">
              They   are strong but surprisingly thin, meaning they are great for surfaces   where a resistance to build up of dirt or dust is required.  The   material is splash proof and has an extremely superior resistance to   wind and environmental factors, therefore it is ideal for products   designed to be taken outside as it is very weatherproof.  Although   polyester labels are not 100% waterproof (our polyethylene labels are a   better choice as a waterproof label), they can be useful in applications   where small amounts of water or oils may come into contact with the   label, such as on soap dispensers or in washrooms, to minimise risks of   the label being ruined.</p>
             <p class="text-justify">
              You can use some inkjet or laser printers   to print your labels (see product details to check suitability) but if   you're printing large volumes or want some help with the design, visit   our<a href="<?=base_url()?>printed-labels/"> personalised label printing</a> page.</p>

 <h4 class="cBlue">Labelling for cosmetic and beauty products</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The high end, quality appearance of a polyester label means you can create an expensive, sophisticated look with little effort. You will see polyester labels used on many cosmetic products, especially with a transparent finish, because of the illusion that there is actually no label - that the details have been printed directly on to the product. Available in a variety of shapes, these labels are perfect for any type of cosmetics or bathroom toiletries - from <a href="<?=base_url()?>a4-sheets/circular/">round labels</a> shaped for lip glosses, oval labels for soaps or shampoos, square labels for blushers, to rectangular labels for bubble bath products. You can also choose a peelable adhesive if you have limited space to over-label existing text (in case of limited printed space).</p>

 <h4 class="cBlue">Tough labels for products that need it</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Do you manufacture products that are constantly in a dirty or unhygienic environment? Or that are consistently being handled? These A4 self-adhesive labels will stick to almost any surface, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, metal, glass and painted or unpainted finishes. This includes tools, machinery and products that will be stored in conditions such as warehouses, garages or sheds. This is why they are often use for warranty labels or asset tags - where you might see a silver polyester label. </p>
<p class="text-justify">
