  <p>If your child has just started school, you may be considering getting back into the workplace. Starting
    your own business is the ultimate solution – it lets you do something you love and gives you total
    freedom when it comes to looking after your children. Using your existing hobby or even taking up a new
    one that will make you money means you’ll enjoy your work. But sometimes it’s difficult to determine
    whether your hobby will work as a viable business, so check out this list of profitable hobbies that you
    can do from the comfort of your own home.</p>
  <h2 class="headingPost">Cake decorating</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3 col-sm-4 pull-right"><img src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>wh-1.jpg"
                                                      class="img-responsive col-xs-12 pull-right"></div>
    <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-8 col-lg-9 col-sm-8">
      <p>If you have a flair for baking then you could easily turn this hobby into a business. Everybody
        enjoys a slice of cake, and you could find yourself making children’s birthday cakes, cute
        cupcakes or elaborate wedding pieces. You’ll probably find you already have the basic materials
        such as cake tins and mixing bowls, but it might be worth buying raw materials such as flour,
        sugar and butter in bulk, and investing in more professional tools such as cake smoothers (for
        getting a quality icing finish on your cakes) and piping tools for more detailed work. You’ll
        also be able to charge more for more elaborate cakes, so this can be a real money maker.</p>
      <p>Place your work on a cake board and adorn with a beautiful ribbon and package your creations in
        beautiful boxes adorned with quality labels, such as those from <a href="#">AA Labels</a>, and
        you’ll have created a beautiful product that people will keep coming back for.</p>

      <h2 class="headingPost">Jewellery maker</h2>
      <p>If you love jewellery and have a creative streak, you might consider setting up your own
        jewellery making business. It’s easy to get started with this as many suppliers offer raw
        materials such as chains and gemstones in bulk. You don’t need to spend a fortune on tools
        either, with many starter kits providing everything you’ll need.</p>
      <p>Create a business name and logo and you’ll be ready to put your brand on the internet. Use a
        marketplace like Etsy to sell your goods and you could earn a tidy profit. Jewellery making can
        be very lucrative as the raw materials are often very cheap versus the prices you can charge for
        your hand-made goods.</p>

  <h2 class="headingPost">Stationery</h2>
  <div class="row">

    <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-8 col-lg-9 col-sm-8">
      <p>If you’re one of these people who have a hoard of beautiful notebooks then you’re probably not
        alone. You could combine your artistic talent with a passion for stationery and create your own
        line of gift cards and wedding invitations. You might even consider branching out into book
        binding to create your own range of notebooks. Consider what you look for in stationery as a
        parent – a reliable shopping list or diary to keep in your handbag – and you might stumble upon
        a profitable niche.</p>

      <h2 class="headingPost">Other ideas</h2>
      <p>All of these ideas are potentially very lucrative, but it doesn’t stop there. You might have a
        passion for fashion and be a whizz on the sewing machine, so why not price up some materials and
        create your own clothes or handbags? If you enjoy food but there isn’t a great demand in your
        local area, you could sell your creations, such as homemade jams and sweets on the internet. If
        you’re not sure whether your hobby could be profitable, see if others are selling similar items
        online. Using reviews can be a great way of seeing if your product’s in demand.</p>

  <p>Nicole Snow’s passions have always been art and helping others. After finding a silk yarn supplier, she

    knitting ability to make her own colourful creations, she worked with others to refine the yarn and help
    other crafters by providing quality raw materials. Nicole’s efforts have seen her business grow from a
    modest single employee to over 300 women, and over 4.5 years, her business has grown by a whopping
    2900%!</p>
