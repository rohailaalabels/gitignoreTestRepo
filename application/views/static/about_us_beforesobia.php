                            <p>AA Labels is a family owned business that specialises in designing, producing and
                                printing labels, so for us the business is all about labels. We have become a market
                                leader in labelling solutions and our labels are an integral part of products and
                                systems used in every major market and industry sector.</p>

                            <p>In 2006 another of the family owned manufacturing business’s requiring labels for product
                                identification and shipment, decided that usage volumes were high enough to justify the
                                investment in machinery to produce the labels required. </p>

                            <p>Once up and running the initial excess capacity was taken up by offering labels to the
                                business’s customers and soon AA Labels was born. </p>
