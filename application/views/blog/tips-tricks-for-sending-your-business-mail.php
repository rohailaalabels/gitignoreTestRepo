    <p>Of all the ways to get people talking about your business, there’s one fundamentally over-looked option,
      and that is good old-fashioned paper and envelope based mail. And this tried and tested favourite has
      been in decline in recent years, so in an era when Internet based promotion is the norm, what can you do
      to make that far more personal connection happen?</p>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>Online marketing is mostly effective because it costs very little for your business to contact
          new customers, and it’s usually much faster and easier to create digital advertising than it is
          using the more traditional print-based method. However, think about how many emails you receive
          throughout any given day. It’s fair to assume that more often than not, most of us get more
          emails than we actually want to read – or are even capable of getting through.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-6">
        <p>However, advertising via post, or by using newsletters, leaflets and catalogues (which is
          sometimes referred to as ‘direct marketing’) offers many advantages that you should definitely
          consider when deciding upon as an advertising plan for your business.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>Not only can you target a smaller, more precise demographic, but you can also contact those
          prospective customers in a way that may be far more effective than online marketing alone. But
          what exactly are the benefits of direct marketing?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>Instead of filling up email inboxes, the direct marketing approach allows you to connect with
          your customers on a much more personal level, and you’re not going to get any closer to your
          existing or potential customers or clients than when using a direct mail strategy.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>By using direct marketing methods such as leaflets and letters, you’re increasing the chances of
          it being seen by far more many people than by standard email alone. Most emails tend to end up
          in spam folder anyways, whereas a personalised correspondence (with a hand written <a href="#">address
          label</a>) is bound to grab people’s attention.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>You can also tailor how you communicate with your target market, and by focusing on little touches such
      as hand-written address labels (or personalised envelopes), you can show that you value people
      individually. By hand writing the customer’s addresses, it demonstrates that an actual human (instead of
      an inconsiderate automatic service) is contacting them, and actually cares about what they have to
      say.</p>

        <p>The personalised touch speaks of truly valuing your recipient, and may just help to create a
          relationship of trust between yourselves and them. One of the problems of modern communication
          is that with the increased reliance on technology and computing, there is an increased concern
          for privacy. There are countless stories and reports of hackers breaking into seemingly secure
          sites, which creates a sense that identity theft has become an ever-pervasive threat, which in
          tern causes certain demographics to no longer trust opening attachments and links that pop up in
          emails.</p>
        <p>What’s really important is that asides from all the doom and gloom, there is a real sense of
          nostalgia to receiving tangible personalised post every now and then. The older generations may
          appreciate it that little bit more, but there’s no getting past the fact that the analogue ways
          of the past have a certain popularised appeal these days as well.</p>

        <p>Now that we’ve hopefully convinced you that your ideas for paper-based newsletters, catalogues
          and leaflets are well worth your efforts, it’s time to take a look at some tips and tricks for
          getting it done as quickly, efficiently and accurately as possible.</p>
        <p>Although there are countless online companies that can take care of every aspect of printing and
          mailing, they tend to be unnecessarily expensive, so for small businesses and hobbyists you can
          certainly take care of it yourself.</p>

        <p>The main thing when it comes to creating the right content for your advertising is just how you
          go about creating exactly what it is you want to get across. Of course you can employ a
          professional writer to do it for you, but this isn’t always the best option. At the end of the
          day, you need to express what it is you’re selling succinctly and clearly, and in a way that
          reflects your business and its core values. Just writing in a way that matches exactly how you
          would like to be spoken to can make all the difference.</p>

        <p>Once you are happy with your literature you can look for companies who are happy to print out the
          kind of numbers you are looking for. These exist on almost any street in a city or town, and
          they may even offer a discount for large bulk orders.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Be smart when it comes to creating your templates for your documents. You can easily make mail merging
      style outlines for your personalised mail, which in turn makes it easier to print out more when
      needed.</p>

        <p>There are many services that are just a mouse click away who would be happy to deal with bulk
          order printing and deliveries, but to make it truly personal it’s worth looking to do a bit of
          DIY. Should you choose to do so there are plenty of online companies who offer a postal
          discounts for bulk deliveries. The main point is to do your research.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>So there you have it. Personalised correspondence can be a fantastic way to connect with your clients,
      and with some planning you can make it that much more personal.</p>
