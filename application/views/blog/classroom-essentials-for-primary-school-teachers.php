      <p>As you’re undoubtedly aware, school budgets for classroom supplies wildly vary from school to
        school. Most schools are going to provide you with the absolute basics of course, but such is
        the case with ever dwindling resources, you may find that they don’t last the year!</p>

      <p>Whatever your situation, it’s always good to think about exactly what you’re going to need for
        the term ahead. With that in mind, here are a few tips to help you cover all the essentials, as
        well a few ideas for what else you might need to stock up on in order to make your life that
        little bit easier.</p>

  <p>First things first, let’s cover the absolute basics. You’re going to need pencils and pens for writing
    tasks (standard and fun coloured markers), as well as colouring crayons and pencils. Other standard
    supplies include notebook paper, sticky tape, folders erasers, a staple remover, glue sticks,
    construction paper and scissors.</p>
  <p>Extra essentials that spring to mind are things such as: a timer or desktop clock so you can make sure
    the lesson isn’t getting ahead of itself; clipboards in case your class are out and about, or sat on the
    floor whilst working; Velcro or magnet strips to bind items together; and maybe even a handy supply of
    healthy snacks and water for you just in case!</p>

  <h2 class="headingPost">Getting Organised</h2>
  <p><img src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>cr-4.jpg" class="img-responsive col-xs-12"></p>
  <p>Aside from the daily necessities, there are plenty more essentials that need your attention. Take for
    example what you need in order to keep on top of things and get extra organised. Only teachers know
    first-hand about the sheer amount of planning and extra work that comes along with the job, so getting
    into the habit of fantastic organisation is an essential skill.</p>
  <p>Start by using plastic tubs or cardboard boxes to store all the materials, books, and supplies that go
    into special art projects. Be sure to label these boxes with the name of each project or unit. Or, you
    could keep different boxes for each student as an easy organisational tool. Storage bins, baskets, and
    magazine files to keep students’ papers and work organised.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-8">
      <p>Consider using index cards or prompt cards if you need them to help with the flow and pace of a
        lesson. You can keep a special box or drawer set aside filled with these lifesavers, which can
        easily be referred to as and when they’re needed. You could even make things easier for you by
        colour coding and labelling these with a handy index in your lesson planner.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-8">
      <p>Speaking of which, you absolutely must find a planner that works for you, so spend the time
        researching your options. Some teachers are happy to have one planner for everything in their
        lives, whilst others may find that having a separate planner for work, home and family works
        best.</p>
      <p></p>

  <div class="clear10"></div>
  <p>It’s also important to keep track of all your students’ grades so you can see at a glance who are doing
    well, improving, or who might need that extra little bit of attention. A separate book, form or folder
    is the easiest way to do this, and it helps to have it labelled as bold and as clear as possible to help
    your kids to have easy access to their own records.</p>
  <p>In terms of keeping work tidy in the classroom, it’s wise to invest in both a thermal laminator, as well
    as a decent paper trimmer. This ensures that important pages are protected and can be reused, and when
    it comes to cutting out thirty worksheets you can get it done quickly and neatly.</p>
  <div class="clear10"></div>
  <h2 class="headingPost">It’s not all work, work, and more work</h2>
  <p><img src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>cr-7.jpg" class="img-responsive col-xs-12"></p>
  <p>Any primary school teacher will tell you that the satisfaction of the job comes from seeing kids grow and
    develop, and how they push themselves both with their work and their social skills. It can be a real
    slog in terms of the academic pressures and sheer amount of work that goes into it, but that’s not to
    say that there isn’t a lot of fun to be had along the way.</p>
  <p>Reading materials such as books, magazines and newspapers are all essentials for the classroom. They can
    provide encouragement for your kids to spend free time reading during their free time instead of staring
    into space. Magazines and papers can also be used for a ton of classroom activities, from paper mache to
    collages and posters, just be sure to label any books so that they don’t end up being used in the same
    way! Books can be sourced from absolutely anywhere, and it’s a nice idea to encourage the children to
    read about topics such as friendship, school, family and rules.</p>
  <p>Show your students how impressed you are with their work by dedicating a section of your wall or board
    with a showcase space. You could treat it as a Wall of Fame or museum of work, so that you can
    congratulate children with <a href="#">star shaped stickers</a> for outstanding work, or even create
    awards for things like being a good listener, most improved, best behaved, and much more.</p>

      <h2 class="headingPost">And finally…</h2>
      <p>You’re going to need an open mind, a great sense of humour, and heaps of positivity and patience.
        Good luck with your career, and be sure to have fun along the way.</p>
