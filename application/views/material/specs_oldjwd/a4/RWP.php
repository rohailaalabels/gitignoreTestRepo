                          <h3 >Applications and use </h3>
                          <p>This  face material is designed for the manufacture of labels on rolls and sheets for  use in copier, inkjet, laser and thermal transfer printers (uncoated white  only). The surface structure provides excellent toner bonding and print  resolution.</p>
                          <p>This  product is ideal for label applications where face stock appearance is less  important such as address, instruction and inventory labels and many other  applications. The face-stock provides limited resistance to moisture,  temperature &amp; chemicals. </p>
