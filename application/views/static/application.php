                            <small>Ever since their invention and commercial introduction in the 1930’s in America,
                                self-adhesive labels have become increasingly popular to the point where they are now
                                almost ubiquitous and can be found on everything from retail price stickers to the sides
                                of planes. The multitudes of technological innovations that have followed their
                                introduction mean that they now can be used for almost any purpose in any
                                environment. </small> <small> Wherever you are in the world now, you will see some sort
                                of label, whether they are representing a brand on the side of an apple, or on the
                                bottom of your shoe, you cannot escape them. The use of self adhesive labels are a major
                                factor in marketing brands and promoting company image by providing a means of
                                delivering information to the end-user and/or prospective end-user prior to, or
                                post-purchase and for many other image and informational purposes. </small></h2>

                                                <p> Beverage manufacturers mainly prefer clear-on-clear labelling
                                                    solutions, which typically involve transparent glass or polyester
                                                    (PET) bottles. This produces a no-label look. These filmic labels
                                                    are also used due to their resistance to water, humidity and cool
                                                    temperatures. </p>
                                                <p> However, paper materials remain popular for certain applications and
                                                    must also be resistant to various conditions.

                                                <p>Food labelling is the most diverse of all label end-uses.</p>
                                                <p> Labels for use in the food industry often need to retain their
                                                    adhesive properties when exposed to cold and moist surfaces, and
                                                    also when placed in deep freeze storage. Labels may also need to be
                                                    resistant to fat and oil. </p>
                                                <p> In addition to these physical properties, labels used in the food
                                                    industry serve the need for an eye-catching effect at the
                                                    point-of-sale and are also an important element in branding.</p>
                                                <p> Packages to be labelled include glass, hard and soft plastics,
                                                    fibre-based materials like paper and card, as well as metals.
                                                    Special areas in food labelling include open-closure (resealing)
                                                    applications.

                                                        rapidly.</p>
                                                    <p> Labels often have to be conformable, squeeze resistant, and
