  <p>Moving house is right up there alongside arranging a wedding day as one of the most stress-inducing
    endeavours we willingly put ourselves through. But having said that, with just the right amount of
    planning and organisation, moving day needn’t be anything other than exciting.</p>
  <p>Aside from the obvious tasks such as getting everything you own packed, figuring out the new commute and
    arranging new schools, there are also whole numbers of other nitty gritty details that need your
    attention.</p>
  <p>With that in mind, here are a few practical admin tasks you may want to consider to make your life that
    little bit easier when it comes to the big day</p>
  <h2 class="headingPost">Let others know you’re moving</h2>
  <p>First things first, it’s important to let all the relevant people know that you’re leaving your current
    home, and to give details on the new address. </p>

                            class="img-responsive col-xs-12 pull-right"></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>You could consider sending out postcards to all of your personal contacts (and professional
        clients if you are self-employed) with details of your change of address. You can use our quick
        and easy online <a href="http://localhost/customlabels.php/">custom label</a> service to make
        some change of address labels to help speed up the process. This will ensure that all the right
        people know where you are.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>One of the first things to do once you’re actually in your new home is to arrange having your <a
                        href="https://www.royalmail.com/personal/receiving-mail/redirection">post redirected</a>. This
    ensures that any sensitive post such as bank statements won’t ever be sent to the old address.</p>
  <h2 class="headingPost">Notify services and utility companies</h2>
  <p>It very important that as close to actually leaving the house for the last time as possible, you make
    sure to take note of your gas and electricity meter readings. This comes in handy when you notify the
    utility companies, as this is often the first thing they will ask for once you’ve given details of the
    new address. Also, by taking the meter readings at the very last minute you’ll also get a more accurate
    final bill.</p>

                            class="img-responsive col-xs-12 pull-right"></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>If you’re renting a house, your tenancy agreement will most likely stipulate exactly how much
        notice the agency (or landlord) requires. The general rule is that the sooner you let them know,
        the better. It’s also best to inform your landlord in writing as this holds more weight as a
        record of correspondence. Additionally, you should arrange a date for an inspection where
        everybody is present at the same time; this avoids the potential for disagreements regarding
        damage.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Be sure to pause or change all regular subscription services you may use such as newspaper, grocery and
    milk deliveries. You may also need to consider (long in advance) arranging reinstallation of services
    such as cable or satellite television services, as well as letting your Internet providers know that
    you’re moving. The sooner you let these companies know, the sooner you can have them up and running at
    your new address.</p>
  <p>You will also have to contact your new local council to notify them for changes with paying your council
    tax. If you are moving far from your local area and are unsure as to exactly who your new local council
    is, you can find out their details <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council">here</a>.</p>
  <h2 class="headingPost">For the big day itself</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3 col-sm-5 pull-right">
      <p><img src="<?=BLOG_ASSETS?>paj-3.jpg"
                            class="img-responsive col-xs-12 pull-right"></p>

      <p>Giving moving day as much preparation as possible is vital to making sure that it runs smoothly.
        It’s a great idea to pack some essentials for moving day itself, as most of your belongings will
        be stored in boxes, under huge piles of other boxes!</p>
      <p>There are certain things that you’ll definitely need such as bedclothes for the first night in
        the new house, as well as a change of clothes for the next day. Toiletries should be accessible,
        as well as things like toilet paper, basic cutlery and crockery, a first aid kit and of course,
        some celebratory champagne for once you’re finally finished! Now all that’s left to do is to
        perhaps have some food delivered and relax, because the next day it’s time to tackle all of the
        unpacking!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That about wraps it up, so remember that when it comes to moving home, get your preparation done and let
    the right people know, and with some work (and a little luck), moving day needn’t be as stressful as
    they say it is.</p>
